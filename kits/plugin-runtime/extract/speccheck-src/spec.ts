 * Verified constants for the MCP 2026-07-28 spec release.

 * Single source of truth for every header name, method name, _meta key, and
 * error code the checks rely on. Each value is annotated with the primary
 * source it was verified against and the date of verification, so a future
 * reader can re-check it against the spec rather than trusting this file.
 *
 * Verified 2026-07-11 against:
 *  - changelog:  https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/changelog
 *  - transport:  https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/transports/streamable-http
 *  - caching:    https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/server/utilities/caching
 *
 * The changelog is authoritative where an individual SEP page disagrees (the
 * SEP pages are stale on the renumbered error codes). The dated
 * /specification/2026-07-28 URLs 404 until GA — every fixUrl below points at
 * /draft or a stable /seps page for now; re-point at dated URLs post-GA.
