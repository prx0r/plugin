# Lessons Learned — Skill Eval Harness

This file records durable lessons from building and using the shared skill evaluation harness across Adewale’s skill repos. Keep it practical: each lesson should change how the harness, manifests, or skill iteration process is run next time.

## 2026-06-09 — Eval generation must fail closed

**Problem:** Early task preparation could leak answer keys or silently proceed with missing hidden prompts.

**Lesson:** Generation tasks and grading materials must be separated by default.

**Rule:**
- Do not include `expected_behavior`, rubrics, or answer keys in prepared tasks unless `--include-answer-key` is explicit.
- Missing `prompt_ref` should fail unless `--allow-missing-prompts` is explicitly used for dry-run planning.
- Hidden holdout/holdback content should stay private until scoring.

## 2026-06-09 — `old_skill` and ablations must be explicit variants

**Problem:** Treating `old_skill` or ablations as implicit defaults makes benchmark rows ambiguous and can compare against nonexistent baselines.

**Lesson:** Every non-default comparison arm needs an explicit manifest/config contract.

**Rule:**
- Default variants are only `with_skill` and `without_skill`.
- `old_skill` requires populated `manifest.old_skill_paths` and `--include-old-skill`.
- Ablations are opt-in with `--include-ablations`.

## 2026-06-09 — Trigger evals are not normal answer evals

**Problem:** Trigger cases were originally stored as meta-prompts such as “Trigger decision eval. User prompt: …”, which tests the classifier prompt, not autonomous skill loading.

**Lesson:** Autonomous trigger tests must run the real user prompt.

**Rule:**
- Extract the embedded real user prompt before running Pi trigger checks.
- Keep trigger/no-trigger cases separate from answer-quality smoke runs.
- Trigger cases should assert skill discovery behavior, not final answer content.

## 2026-06-09 — Trigger detection must use real load evidence, not names

**Problem:** Bare skill names caused false positives. Example: reading `good-readme/README.md` looked like loading the `good-readme` skill.

**Lesson:** Detect skill loading from copied temp skill paths, not from names or repo filenames.

**Rule:**
- Match only the temp copied `SKILL.md` path or its temp skill directory.
- Seed the temp Pi config with auth/settings, but not the user’s installed skills.
- Nonzero/timeout trigger runs are failures, not silent no-trigger passes.

## 2026-06-09 — Strong models make many evals saturated

**Problem:** Several cases had `with_skill=1.0` and `without_skill=1.0`; this is not a skill failure, but it is weak evidence of skill lift.

**Lesson:** Saturation and skill quality are different measurements.

**Rule:**
- Track `with_skill` pass rate separately from discrimination/lift.
- Keep saturated/no-lift flags as eval-quality signals.
- Add harder fixtures or artifact-level checks when `without_skill` also passes.

## 2026-06-09 — “All saturated” must be defined before optimizing

**Problem:** “Saturated” can mean either “with-skill passes everything” or “no-skill also passes,” which leads to opposite actions.

**Lesson:** Define saturation as the target metric for the current loop.

**Rule used in this round:**
- Answer-quality saturation: every `with_skill` smoke row has objective pass rate `1.0`.
- Trigger saturation: every tune trigger/no-trigger case passes autonomous skill-discovery classification.
- Do not weaken evals just to make flags disappear.

## 2026-06-09 — Missing outputs are not failed/no-lift cases

**Problem:** Unrun or missing outputs were initially counted like failed rows, creating false no-lift flags.

**Lesson:** Distinguish “not measured” from “measured and failed.”

**Rule:**
- Missing outputs should be marked `missing_output` and excluded from no-lift/saturation comparisons.
- Timeouts should write explicit artifacts and metadata so the benchmark can grade or flag them consistently.

## 2026-06-09 — Smoke runs need hard bounds

**Problem:** A Slide Maker architecture case spent the whole timeout in planning/thinking and produced no final answer.

**Lesson:** Eval runners need stricter execution envelopes than normal agent work.

**Rule:**
- Use minimal thinking for smoke runs.
- Add bounded-response instructions.
- Capture timeout output/metadata instead of aborting the whole round.
- For underspecified project-deck tasks, require bounded/no-write mode rather than open-ended build loops.

## 2026-06-09 — Fixture-backed cases are better than keyword-only prompts

**Problem:** Inline-only prompts can be solved from generic knowledge or by matching assertion keywords.

**Lesson:** Real files make evals more diagnostic.

**Rule:**
- Use `case.files` for source-backed drift, planted bugs, artifact audits, and repo-specific claims.
- Validate fixture paths in `validate`.
- Emit absolute `input_files` in `prepare` and tell runners to read them before answering.

## 2026-06-09 — Assertions should allow equivalent good behavior

**Problem:** Correct outputs failed when assertions expected overly narrow wording, e.g. `Decision: BLOCK` but the output used `**Decision: BLOCK.**`.

**Lesson:** Objective assertions should test behavior, not one phrasing.

**Rule:**
- Prefer semantically meaningful contains/regex variants.
- Calibrate only when the output clearly satisfies the intended behavior.
- Do not calibrate away genuine misses.

## 2026-06-09 — Frontmatter descriptions are the trigger boundary

**Problem:** Skills over-triggered or under-triggered because frontmatter descriptions were too broad or omitted common invocation language.

**Lesson:** Trigger evals are mostly description evals.

**Rule:**
- Include common positive trigger phrases in `description`.
- Include explicit negative boundaries when adjacent skills exist.
- Re-run autonomous trigger tests after every description change.

Examples from saturation work:
- `good-readme`: narrowed away full docs sites and launch-readiness audits.
- `audit-skill`: narrowed away conceptual security-audit explainers.
- `good-repo`: narrowed away function-level test-writing.
- `cfdoctor`: narrowed away generic Cloudflare status questions.
- `guardrails`: narrowed away README/prose-only edits.
- `anti-slop-writing`: added “tighten,” “talk intro,” and “generic launch copy.”

## 2026-06-09 — Ablations are not evidence until they are run

**Problem:** The manifests declare many ablations, but no benchmark report currently contains `ablation:<id>` rows.

**Lesson:** Ablations are useful planning scaffolds, but not proof of load-bearing instructions until measured.

**Rule:**
- Run ablations on discriminating cases where `with_skill=1.0` and `without_skill<1.0`.
- Treat no-regression ablations as evidence that either the component is redundant/unclear or current evals do not exercise it.
- Next improvement: materialize ablated skill variants or generate explicit ablation patches instead of only instruction-simulating removal.

**Update (2026-07-02):** the "next improvement" shipped. `materialize-ablations` writes real, altered skill trees (removal-only), the runners mount them, and the benchmark report's `ablation_regressions` block confirms a regression per cited case only against verified provenance (`docs/skill-ablation-spec.md`). Instruction-simulated ablations remain supported but `audit-manifest` now flags them as non-blind, raw-measurement-only.

## 2026-06-09 — Holdout and holdback still matter after tune saturation

**Problem:** Tune saturation can create false confidence.

**Lesson:** Public/tune success is not release proof.

**Rule:**
- Tune cases are for iteration.
- Holdout is for end-of-round scoring.
- Holdback stays hidden from skill/docs/evals until after scoring to detect overfitting.
- Do not claim release-quality proof until hidden prompts, private answer keys, and real fixtures are filled and scored.

## 2026-06-09 — Jetty should be an adapter, not a rewrite

**Problem:** Jetty has useful trajectory/runbook/sandbox execution features, but the harness manifest and grading contract should remain the source of truth.

**Lesson:** External runners should execute tasks and return artifacts; the local harness should own manifests, grading, and reports.

**Rule:**
- Add `export-jetty`, `run-jetty`, and `import-jetty-results` as adapters.
- Preserve local variants, splits, assertions, fixture files, and judge-result imports.
- Keep Jetty open questions in `TODO.md` until API-token-backed testing is done.

## 2026-06-09 — Do not fake ecosystem telemetry

**Problem:** It was possible to reverse-engineer `skills.sh` telemetry, but raw pokes would be dishonest.

**Lesson:** Marketplace/install metrics should only come from official user-like flows.

**Rule:**
- Use official CLI installs only.
- Do not forge install telemetry or call tracking endpoints directly.

## 2026-06-11 — No-skill baselines need filesystem isolation

**Problem:** A Pi smoke run with `without_skill` still found `skills/good-pr/SKILL.md` because the runner executed from the source repo. `--no-skills` stopped explicit skill loading, but grep/find/read could still discover the skill files and public eval manifests.

**Lesson:** A disabled-skill flag is not a variant boundary when the runner can read the source workspace.

**Rule:**
- Run each generation task from a per-variant temporary workspace.
- Copy skill files only for `with_skill`, `old_skill`, and materialized ablation variants.
- For `without_skill`, provide only fixture inputs and pass `--no-skills` when the runner supports it.
- Keep eval manifests, skill folders, and public answer scaffolding out of the no-skill workspace.
- Add variant-scoped process assertions: `skill_invoked=true` for `with_skill`; `skill_invoked=false` for `without_skill`.

## 2026-06-11 — Process assertions need real trace evidence

**Problem:** Final output grading could not show whether a skill was loaded, which commands ran, or whether a run stayed inside tool/token/time budgets. Manifest-only process assertions would either fail without evidence or tempt the harness to infer process from answer text.

**Lesson:** Process and efficiency claims are only valid when runner artifacts support them.

**Rule:**
- Runners should write raw `trace.jsonl` plus normalized `events.json` and `metrics.json`.
- Do not infer skill-load or command evidence from final `output.md` prose.
- Keep process/efficiency assertions fail-closed when required evidence is missing.
- Add production process assertions only after a real runner has emitted stable evidence for that case and variant.

## 2026-06-11 — Normalize observed runner shapes, not imagined schemas

**Problem:** Pi, Codex, and Jetty expose different event shapes. Codex emitted `item.completed` / `command_execution` and `turn.completed` usage records; Pi exposed `message_end` usage aliases; Jetty trajectory shapes are still only documented/mocked until live token validation.

**Lesson:** The normalized trace schema is an adapter boundary, not a reason to pretend every runner already emits the same evidence.

**Rule:**
- Preserve raw runner events before normalization.
- Add fixture tests for every event shape the adapter claims to support.
- Count completed command events, not in-progress starts or command output text.
- Mark documented/mocked Jetty trajectory import as useful but not production-grade until `JETTY_API_TOKEN` live validation confirms response shapes.
- Keep source-specific unknowns in docs or `TODO.md` instead of hiding them behind generic trace language.

## 2026-06-11 — Specs need a release-tense pass

**Problem:** After v0.4.1 shipped, the trace-aware spec still described some shipped behavior as future work. That made the docs internally inconsistent even though the code and changelog were correct.

**Lesson:** Specs become misleading when release state changes but tense and caveats do not.

**Rule:**
- After each release, scan docs for stale “proposal,” “next,” and “first implementation” language.
- Separate shipped behavior from follow-on work in specs.
- Keep live-validation caveats visible, especially for external adapters.
- Record docs-only corrections in `CHANGELOG.md` under `Unreleased`.

## 2026-06-30 — Multi-skill eval suites must be allowlisted and pinned

**Problem:** A broad filesystem scan for `*/evals/shared-benchmark.json` pulled in an unrelated top-level tool (`beautiful-mermaid`) when the intended scope was the pinned 10-skill study. That silently changed the matrix, cost, and interpretation of the run.

**Lesson:** Suite scope is part of the experiment contract. It must be explicit, reviewable, and reproducible before any model calls are made.

**Rule:**
- Use a suite allowlist (`examples/adewale-workspace/all-manifests.txt`) as the source of truth; never glob arbitrary repos for official runs.
- Run `skill-benchmark suite-run ... --tier preflight` before expensive tiers.
- Fail closed on top-level manifests not present in the allowlist unless the run is explicitly exploratory.
- Verify skill tree hashes with `examples/skill-pins.json`; if a skill repo is intentionally updated, refresh pins as a conscious act and rerun preflight.
- Save `RUN_SCOPE.json` with every suite run and treat it as the audit record for what was actually evaluated.

## 2026-06-30 — Cost is an eval-quality signal, not just an invoice

**Problem:** Per-run Pi metadata contained token and dollar cost, but the harness did not promote it into a suite-level artifact. The latest allowlisted full matrix had enough raw telemetry to show ~82.6M generation tokens and ~$175.21 in provider-reported Pi generation cost, but judge and trigger costs were not persisted.

**Lesson:** Cost must be normalized and reported next to quality metrics so we can distinguish useful signal from expensive noise.

**Rule:**
- Preserve raw provider `usage`/`cost`, but also write normalized `usage_normalized` and `cost_normalized` blocks with source/provenance.
- Report suite totals by skill, case, variant, runner, and ablation.
- Track coverage: runs with token telemetry, runs with dollar telemetry, missing usage, and missing cost.
- Add budget gates for PR smoke, nightly tune, and release/full-ablation tiers.
- Use cost-quality findings: expensive saturated cases, expensive no-lift cases, judge-heavy cases that could be deterministic, and ablations with high spend but no confirmable expected regression.
- Do not mix missing cost with zero cost; offline/stub runners should mark telemetry as `not_applicable`.

**Update (2026-07-02):** implemented as issue #21. Every runner path writes normalized `usage_normalized`/`cost_normalized` blocks with explicit provenance (missing is marked, never zero); `benchmark`/`aggregate` carry a `cost_summary`; `cost-summary` writes the standalone ledger; `suite-run` gates on `--max-estimated-cost-usd`/`--max-estimated-tokens`; `token-overhead` reports dollar deltas and lift-per-dollar; and `audit-manifest --runs` emits the cost-quality findings above.

Latest allowlisted Pi generation cost snapshot (`safe-suite-20260630-201448-pi`; excludes judge and trigger cost because those paths did not persist usage/cost):

| Skill | Runs | Total tokens | Cost (USD) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| swiss-poster-skill | 1,272 | 44,808,350 | 124.34 |
| cfdoctor | 176 | 9,625,548 | 12.83 |
| testing-best-practices | 276 | 9,204,778 | 12.11 |
| slide-maker | 118 | 3,199,560 | 5.10 |
| good-readme | 117 | 3,933,828 | 4.15 |
| guardrails-skill | 164 | 2,283,690 | 3.92 |
| audit-skill | 138 | 4,270,346 | 3.79 |
| good-pr | 124 | 1,659,912 | 3.65 |
| good-repo | 107 | 2,647,480 | 3.55 |
| anti-slop-writing | 76 | 1,005,364 | 1.75 |
| **Total** | **2,568** | **82,638,856** | **175.21** |

## 2026-06-30 — The full matrix is slow because ablations and judges multiply calls

**Problem:** The full allowlisted suite took a long time because it was not one eval; it was thousands of model interactions. The matrix included 514 baseline Pi generation calls, 2,054 ablation generation calls, and 2,358 judge calls. Median Pi generation latency was about 27s, p90 about 42s, with some 180s timeouts.

**Lesson:** Runtime is dominated by multiplicative design choices: answer cases × variants × ablations × repeats × judges. The ablation matrix is especially expensive when every ablation applies to every answer case.

**Rule:**
- Run tiers deliberately: preflight/static first, smoke subset second, full tune only when needed, holdout/release last.
- Narrow ablation applicability to cases that can actually exercise the removed component.
- Prefer materialized ablations with structured expected regressions over broad instruction-simulated ablations.
- Keep judge assertions for properties deterministic checks cannot express; replace judge-heavy checks with script/artifact oracles when possible.
- Use historical cost summaries to select a cheap high-signal smoke subset and reserve expensive cases for nightly or release runs.

## 2026-07-02 — Make the measurement believable before scaling what you measure

**Problem:** The eval-framework roadmap wanted to scale what the harness reports — graded scores, multi-model lift, more assertion families. But the one number it already prints (lift = `with_skill` − `without_skill`) rested on three things that were *intended* but never *enforced*: that detectors do not fire falsely or stay silent falsely, that the `without_skill` baseline truly cannot read the skill, and that grading is deterministic and model-free. A graded or multi-model feature built on an unverified detector only scales an unverified result.

**Lesson:** Test the harness before extending it. A reported difference is only as trustworthy as the detectors, the baseline isolation, and the determinism underneath it — and those are cheap to make executable.

**Rule:**
- Ship the "confidence floor" first: paired should-fire/should-pass fixtures per objective detector (`tests/fixtures/detectors/`), a cross-runner `without_skill` isolation invariant, re-grade idempotence, and a guard that the core grade path calls no model and no network (`tests/test_confidence_floor.py`).
- A new objective assertion type does not land without its should-fire/should-pass fixture pair; a meta-test enforces this so a detector cannot be trusted on entry without one.
- A new runner registers its workspace builder so the baseline-isolation invariant covers it automatically; it must not hand-roll its own isolation check.
- Sequence the floor before the buckets: a believable small number beats an impressive unverified one.

## 2026-07-02 — A new scoring tier or fan-out axis must be threaded through every consumer

**Problem:** Two cross-cutting additions caused silent errors far from where they were defined. Adding a `soft` severity tier (meant to feed only the graded score) still moved `combined_pass_rate`, still failed JUnit test cases, and still fed the held-out-vs-tune visibility report — because those consumers counted *all* qualitative rows, not the gated subset. Adding a `model` fan-out axis collided judge verdicts across models, because `judge_task_id` identified a run by `(case, variant, run)` and never learned the new axis, so the last-loaded verdict silently applied to every model. A PR review caught all of these after the features "worked" in isolation.

**Lesson:** A cross-cutting dimension (severity, model) touches every place that *aggregates* a run or *identifies* a run, not just the place that defines it. The blast radius is the set of report views and keys, not the feature's own function.

**Rule:**
- When you add a severity tier, audit every pass-rate/totals consumer (`grade_case_variant` totals, `build_benchmark_report`, JUnit/`report`, readiness signals, the visibility split) — soft must never move a pass rate anywhere.
- When you add a fan-out axis, audit `run_dir`, run discovery, *and* every identity key that names a run (`judge_task_id`), keeping the segment optional so single-axis records are unchanged.
- Distinguish populations that share a mechanism: a "soft objective" check (e.g. `similarity`) and a "soft judge" verdict both live in the soft bucket, but a judge-visibility report must filter by the actual shape (`qualitative_assertions`), never by a blended proxy (`soft_total`).
- A parse-then-persist step must forward the whole payload: the judge command dropped `dimension_scores`/`criteria` from its stored row, so graded-dimension judging silently degraded to failed plain verdicts. Have the producer and the merge derive the verdict through one shared owner, not two parallel code paths.

## 2026-07-02 — Prose-to-code references rot on every large change; make them executable

**Problem:** A single large merge stranded roughly fifty `name:line` references in `TODO.md` and the specs — every function reference the docs used to anchor prose to code drifted by tens to hundreds of lines. Nothing detected it, so the docs read as precise while pointing at the wrong lines.

**Lesson:** Any hand-maintained pointer from prose to code drifts silently the moment the code moves. Precision that is not checked becomes confident misinformation.

**Rule:**
- A unit test resolves every documented `name:line` / `` `name` (`:line`) `` reference to the actual definition line and fails on drift (`tests/test_doc_refs.py`); fixing a failure is mechanical (the message carries the correct line).
- Every new field, command, assertion type, or flag is reflected in `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same change that adds it — the changelog is the release contract, not an afterthought.
- Keep new manifest surfaces additive with behavior-preserving defaults, and regression-test that a pre-change manifest grades to identical pass rates, so "we upgraded the harness" never silently means "your old evals now score differently."
- After a batch lands, give the docs a release-tense and status pass (per the 2026-06-11 lesson) and annotate — do not silently rewrite — any earlier "next improvement" note that has since shipped.

**Update (2026-07-06):** the reference guard now has a sibling for the other rot vector. `tests/test_doc_links.py` resolves every relative doc link — file target and `#anchor`, fence- and inline-code-aware — so the docs restructure (moat-first README, `docs/commands.md` split out) could move sections without silently stranding a cross-link. Prose→code and prose→doc are the same failure mode; both are now executable.

## 2026-07-06 — A concept with N copies drifts; consolidate to one owner and guard the fork

**Problem:** Several concepts had been implemented more than once and the copies had silently diverged, each divergence a real behavioral bug rather than a style nit. The answer runners (`run-codex`, `run-claude`, `run_subagent_tasks`) each hand-rolled the raw-result→run-contract adaptation, and the Codex empty-output path wrote `metadata.json` without the normalized usage/cost blocks the others always wrote (and `schema_version: 1` where the subagent wrote 2). The trigger runners (`skill-pi-trigger-eval`, `skill-trigger-matrix`) had re-forked repo-root resolution, manifest loading, skill-tree mounting, the Pi argv, and subprocess-timeout handling — so a manifest outside `evals/` mounted from a different root than `benchmark` used, and YAML/`dataset_files` manifests that worked in the harness silently broke in the runners. The case/model/variant/run walk existed as four hand-synced copies; the timeout encoding as eight `1800` literals with three different failure shapes (one lost the `timed_out` flag entirely); `ablation:<id>` parsing as 14 inline `split(":", 1)`/`startswith` sites; the token-usage alias table as three drifted copies that could classify the same provider payload differently.

**Lesson:** Duplication is not a cosmetic problem — every copy is a place the behavior can quietly disagree, and the disagreement surfaces as wrong metadata, a wrong mount root, or a dropped manifest, not as a failing test. A concept needs exactly one owner, and the "one owner" property has to be enforced at the source level or it re-forks on the next change.

**Rule:**
- One owner per concept, named for the behavior: `write_runner_outcome`/`RunnerOutcome` (run-contract adaptation), `discovered_run_units` (the run walk), `mount_skill_tree`/`run_argv_with_timeout`/`pi_argv` (trigger-runner plumbing), `DEFAULT_RUNNER_TIMEOUT_S` + the `timed_out: true`/returncode-124 convention (timeout encoding), `ABLATION_VARIANT_PREFIX`/`is_ablation_variant()`/`ablation_id_of()` (ablation parsing), one `USAGE_ALIASES` table, `is_trigger_case`/`is_judge_only_case` (population boundaries).
- Consolidation that touches artifact shape must be behavior-preserving on the numbers: grading, pass rates, cost totals, and verdicts stay byte-identical; the only intended effect is that all runners now emit *one* shape. State that explicitly so a reviewer knows added keys are zero/empty and readers tolerate them.
- Add a source-level guard that forbids re-forking, not just a behavior test: `tests/test_consolidation_guards.py` source-checks that no answer runner hand-rolls a run-level contract write, that the trigger helpers *are* the harness's functions (identity, not equality), that the runner `--timeout` flags share `DEFAULT_RUNNER_TIMEOUT_S`, and that the evidence-class literal is not re-spelled.
- A helper named for one caller lies once three callers share it: `codex_skill_workspace`/`codex_task_prompt` became `build_skill_workspace`/`build_task_prompt` because `run-codex`, `run-claude`, and `run-subagent` all mount and prompt through them. Name for behavior, not for the first caller.
- When two implementations must legitimately differ, make the difference a named, documented decision, not two private copies: `discover_on_disk_run_rows` sits beside `discovered_run_units` because the suite ledger deliberately bills every on-disk arm while grading is variant-scoped.

## 2026-07-06 — Autonomous activation is its own measurement, not a corner of answer-lift

**Problem:** The harness's headline number is answer-lift (`with_skill` − `without_skill`), and every answer runner *force-loads* the skill to isolate answer quality from discovery. But force-loading measures whether the skill helps once found; it says nothing about whether the agent finds it on its own — and that discovery behavior varies by agent and by model, which the force-loaded path structurally cannot see.

**Lesson:** Whether a skill activates is a different construct from whether it helps, measured on a different population with opposite polarity, and it varies across the (agent, model) grid. Folding it into the answer-lift path would either force-load (and measure nothing about discovery) or contaminate the answer measurement. It belongs beside answer-lift as a first-class, un-force-loaded measurement, not inside it.

**Rule:**
- Measure activation per (agent, model) cell with the skill mounted where the agent discovers skills on its own — never force-loaded — and report trigger rates split by should-fire / should-not-fire polarity (`skill-trigger-matrix` / `run_trigger_matrix.py`).
- Give each run a clean discovery environment: a fresh `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` per run so personal skills stay out while the agent's built-ins stay in. A leaked config dir turns "did it discover the skill" into "did it already have the skill."
- Keep the discovery population out of the answer graders: `is_trigger_case` routes `kind: "trigger"` cases away from `benchmark`/`grade`/the judge collector so a discovery output is never graded or judge-billed as an answer, and the report stamps the `raw_autonomous_trigger_measurement` evidence class (owned once as `TRIGGER_MEASUREMENT_EVIDENCE_CLASS`).
- Ship an offline deterministic adapter (`stub`) that decides from the mounted description, so a weakened description measurably under-triggers in CI without a model call; other agents register via an `AgentAdapter` subclass rather than re-forking the mount/detect loop (per the one-owner lesson above).

## 2026-07-07 — Native agent parity is mostly subprocess contracts, not model prompting

**Problem:** Adding Claude/Codex parity looked like "call another CLI", but the live run exposed three non-prompting failure modes: Claude can return a JSON envelope with `is_error:true` and exit 0; Codex structured output requires provider-strict JSON Schema (`additionalProperties:false`, nullable optionals); and Codex answer runs need an isolated, config-light invocation (`--skip-git-repo-check --ephemeral --ignore-user-config --ignore-rules --sandbox read-only -`) or local user config/MCPs leak into eval cost and stderr.

**Lesson:** Treat every agent backend as an adapter contract: argv construction, cwd, timeout, error envelope semantics, final-message extraction, schema adaptation, telemetry normalization, and failure-body writing are the product. The prompt is only one field in that contract.

**Rule:**
- Native answer runners enter through one `run-agent` path and write through `RunnerOutcome`/`write_runner_outcome`; compatibility commands (`run-claude`, `run-codex`) stay thin wrappers.
- A provider-reported error envelope is an infrastructure failure even when the process exits 0; never grade a quota message as an answer.
- Codex judge verdicts come from `--output-last-message`, while stdout JSONL is telemetry; adapt schemas for the provider, then validate returned verdicts against the harness's canonical schema.
- Run live parity checks with the smallest models first, and record quota/auth/config failures as eval-run artifacts rather than losing the row.

**Follow-up from PR audit:** these failures were exactly what Correctness by Construction is meant to prevent. The fix was not another scatter of checks; it moved invariants into the adapter boundary: native subprocess calls require an explicit cwd, all native invocations share one process-group timeout/spawn-failure contract, and provider-specific schema conversion constructs a strict schema before Codex ever sees it. Tests now try to reach the invalid states directly: repo-cwd inheritance, missing executable with no artifact, and graded-dimension schemas without strict object constraints.

## 2026-07-10 — Telemetry is evidence, not a nullable number

**Problem:** Normalized telemetry made several materially different states look alike: absent data could be treated as zero, partial traces could support a negative process assertion, legacy numeric fields looked as trustworthy as provider evidence, and unlike currency/basis/model arms could flow into a lift-per-dollar ratio.

**Lesson:** A number becomes decision evidence only with an explicit observation state, provenance, and comparison basis. “No value,” “not applicable,” “known subtotal,” “measured zero,” and “blocked comparison” must remain different states all the way to the report.

**Rule:**
- Use the schema-v3 typed telemetry envelope as the canonical interior: `available`, `unavailable`, and `not_applicable` measurements; complete/partial aggregates; and comparable/blocked pair results.
- Never coerce missing telemetry to zero. Preserve a real zero as available evidence, expose partial aggregates only as `known_*` subtotals, and fail process/efficiency assertions closed when trace observation is incomplete.
- Require matching case/run/model/population/billing/provenance evidence before causal deltas or lift ratios; legacy telemetry stays readable as `legacy_unverified` but cannot establish a causal comparison.
- Treat currency as a unit, not a display label: preserve object currencies, bucket non-USD amounts, populate dollar fields only from USD evidence, and never use foreign-currency rows in a USD historical-cost denominator without an explicit FX policy.
- Migration is a data transaction: stage replacements, track which files actually moved/installed, restore only those files on failure, and fault-inject every rename boundary in tests.

## 2026-07-10 — A live smoke passes only when its artifacts pass

**Problem:** The first comprehensive CLI smoke returned success because harness subprocesses exited zero, even when Vibe artifacts contained authentication failures and Pi missed the positive trigger. Its generated trigger fixture initially lacked an explicit negative expectation; persistent output paths also risked running stale tasks after a failed prepare.

**Lesson:** Process exit status proves only that the harness command ran. A smoke is useful only when it validates the semantic artifact contract and its declared fixture population.

**Rule:**
- Make paid live checks explicit (`--live`) and start with the smallest models, but make failure honest: inspect `execution_valid`, observation completeness, treatment assertions, and trigger pass rows rather than trusting the wrapper's exit code.
- Require the exact expected fixture set: one positive and one negative trigger query, each once, with no duplicate or substituted row able to satisfy the check.
- Reject an empty agent selection. Short-circuit an agent after failed `prepare`/run/benchmark prerequisites, and place every invocation in a unique attempt directory so stale artifacts can never spend provider budget.
- Persist `smoke.json` and all attempt artifacts. Auth/config/model failures are valuable capability findings (for example, missing `MISTRAL_API_KEY` or a small model that does not activate a skill), not results to hide or silently convert to N/A.
- Inspect the telemetry envelope, not only pass rates. A successful provider call can have provider-reported usage/cost and no trace; in that state tool, command, file, retry, and skill-invocation measurements must remain unavailable rather than become zeros.

## 2026-07-10 — Independent audit should attack the rollback paths

**Problem:** A broad green suite initially missed migration data loss on a second rename failure, a false singleton pairing, cross-currency USD budget dilution, and several smoke false-success paths. These were found by independent reviewers constructing adversarial states rather than by happy-path checks.

**Lesson:** Cross-cutting contracts need adversarial review after implementation, especially where an apparently harmless fallback changes the meaning of evidence.

**Rule:**
- Split audits by domain integrity, producer/CLI integration, and test/CI quality; give reviewers the PR diff and ask for executable counterexamples.
- Turn every confirmed finding into a regression test at the boundary: failed second backup, non-finite payload, mixed currency, mismatched run key, partial timeout trace, empty smoke selection, missing polarity row, and failed prerequisite.
- Re-run the full suite, clean-install test command, packaging build, whitespace/doc-reference guards, and a targeted re-audit after fixes. A passing unit suite alone is not release evidence for a schema, migration, or live-control-plane change.

## 2026-07-10 — Parse process success into a semantic state before measuring it

**Problem:** Pi could exit zero while its terminal JSON event reported a provider error. The process dictionary still permitted `returncode=0`, `observation_complete=true`, numeric telemetry, and a passing negative trigger to coexist. Repeated lifecycle usage and unknown events were also interpreted through generic additive/tool defaults.

**Lesson:** Correct telemetry types cannot repair an invalid invocation state assembled upstream. External process and provider wires must first be parsed into one closed semantic state; every downstream value should be derived from that state.

**Rule:**
- Use `InvocationOutcome` as the internal subprocess state machine; timeout, spawn, process, provider, protocol, and harness failures are not independent booleans.
- Parse Pi JSON once into `PiStream`; require a terminal agent event, treat terminal usage as cumulative, and make failed streams structurally unable to carry numeric usage/cost.
- Derive `triggered` from typed evidence and `pass` from `TriggerObservation`; never accept either as an independent internal input.
- Re-parse persisted rows at the disk trust boundary before a smoke trusts them. Types protect only the interior; wire artifacts must re-establish the contract.
- Exhaust the finite state/truth tables and keep sanitized provider fixtures. Happy-path mocks do not prove an external protocol parser.

## 2026-07-10 — Pair first, derive second, serialize last

**Problem:** Several paths still let contradictory or incomparable facts coexist after the trigger pipeline was fixed. Pairing averaged arms before proving repetition/model/population identity; runner results could combine timeout, return code, answer, and error; imported judge rows trusted truthiness and file order; partial task rows had the same type as executable tasks; Jetty and trace statuses were open strings; and ablation provenance accepted open vocabularies.

**Lesson:** Validation at each `if` is weaker than making the downstream function accept only a value whose constructor already proves the invariant. Identity is part of a measurement, lifecycle is a sum type, and booleans such as “passed” or “successful” should be derived views—not additional state to synchronize.

**Rule:**
- Construct exact experimental identities before arithmetic. One `(case, model, repetition, population)` key admits one arm of each kind; missing/ineligible arms are blocked data, and duplicates are errors rather than last-write-wins.
- Model mutually exclusive outcomes as frozen variants and make artifact writers exhaustive over them. Keep compatibility factories only at old call boundaries; new code constructs the explicit variant.
- Parse stored verdicts and provider states when they enter the process, then revalidate them when read from disk. A typed interior does not make JSON trustworthy by osmosis.
- Separate permissive drafts from executable values. Rendering a partial task is not permission to spawn a model with it.
- Count lifecycle operations only when completion is proven. A start event, missing status, or unknown alias is observation uncertainty—not a zero-cost completed tool call.
- Preserve protocol failure as its own state. Jetty completed-without-output and a conflicting discriminator are not ordinary model failures, and timeout is not provider failure.
- Close domain vocabularies at the parser. Unknown ablation modes, populations, component classes, and mechanisms must fail where they cross the boundary, not survive as valid-looking provenance.
- Test the model gap directly: enumerate finite state tables, attempt every contradictory constructor, inject duplicate/mismatched identities, and use sanitized provider-shaped fixtures. Coverage of lines is not proof that illegal combinations are unrepresentable.

## 2026-07-10 — An upgrade guide must follow the artifacts, not only the manifest

**Problem:** The 0.6.0 release keeps manifest versions 1 and 2 compatible, but that fact alone understates the upgrade. Saved judge rows, paired results, Jetty records, trigger fixtures, Codex wrappers, and telemetry reports now cross stricter boundaries; a user could pass manifest validation and still see rejected inputs or changed denominators.

**Lesson:** Package, manifest, and artifact migrations are separate operations. Release notes name what changed; an upgrade runbook must tell a user which files to preserve, which dry run to inspect, why a report can change, and how to return to the exact prior evidence.

**Rule:**
- Keep the last released run tree and report untouched until the new report is accepted. Test an upgrade in a fresh environment and a copied run tree.
- Say which old inputs fail, which remain readable, and which numbers change because the measurement became stricter. “Backward compatible” is too broad when JSON still parses but no longer supports a comparison.
- Give manifest migration and telemetry migration different names and commands. Do not let a version-1 → version-2 manifest guide stand in for a package upgrade.
- Make rollback restore whole artifacts rather than delete newly added fields. The old report must be reproducible from the same bytes it originally read.
- Add the version-specific section to the single upgrade runbook before the release tag, then verify every install command against the published package before marking the release complete.

## 2026-07-10 — Evidence channels form a product, not a success ladder

**Problem:** A successful subprocess was allowed to certify an absent trace. The same audit found the pattern elsewhere: malformed Claude bytes became an answer, Vibe tool events became an answer, failed Jetty events became complete operation telemetry, one observed judge cost became complete panel spend, an empty events file became command coverage, and internally contradictory budget-history fields could establish an estimate.

**Lesson:** Process exit, provider response, trace, artifact durability, and aggregate coverage are independent evidence channels. Success on one axis cannot upgrade another. A decision that needs several channels must derive its eligibility from their product.

**Rule:**
- Represent process, provider-response, trace, and artifact-set state explicitly as complete, incomplete, or unknown. Derive operation evidence only when process, provider response, and trace are all complete.
- Preserve actual process facts. A zero-exit protocol failure keeps return code zero and carries a separate failed provider-response state.
- Treat legacy generic completion as provider-response evidence only. Without explicit process or trace facts, those channels stay unknown; compatibility is not permission to invent provenance.
- Reserve derived evidence keys so caller extras cannot overwrite them. Parse malformed provider output into diagnostics, never into an answer/verdict fallback. A reporting mode may retain diagnostics, but it must not let a schema-invalid verdict pass.
- Keep partial aggregates partial. One observed panel cost is a known subtotal, not the panel total; a cached scalar may establish a budget estimate only when its aggregate value, observed count, and coverage agree.
- Build run artifacts in a staging directory, write the digest inventory last, and atomically replace the destination. Restore the prior committed run if installation fails; stale or mixed-generation files must never look like one durable observation.
- Verify the producer-owned inventory when reading. Files added later by downstream grading do not retroactively invalidate the committed producer set, while legacy directories without a marker remain readable with artifact-set state unknown.
- Test the full finite-state product and the monotonicity rule: changing one axis to complete must not change another axis or make a multi-axis claim eligible by itself. Add provider-shaped malformed-wire, tamper, stale-file, and fault-injected rollback cases—not only happy paths.

## 2026-07-29 — A proof erased to a dictionary is not architecture

**Problem:** The typed-trigger change constructed a valid `TriggerObservation` and immediately
called `as_row()`. The pre-existing matrix and Pi summarizers still consumed `dict[str, Any]` and
computed `sum(row["pass"]) / len(rows)`. Because the row encoded incomplete as `pass=false`, a
failed invocation became a `0/N` skill-quality result. The worker-failure test even pinned
`passed == 0`, so it certified the lossy projection instead of the measurement invariant.

The repository history shows the same sequence elsewhere: first add a local missing-output filter;
then add `execution_valid`; then route known views through `scorable_run`; then add `ResultSet`; then
discover an example or newly added report that still iterates raw rows. Source-inspection guards
made named consumers call the preferred helper, but could not stop a new consumer or an equivalent
hand-written loop.

**Lesson:** A domain value is proof only while downstream APIs require that value. Converting it to
an open dictionary before aggregation discards the type-level distinction and returns correctness
to convention. Static analysis helps when the architecture exposes a real sum type; it cannot infer
the semantics of `dict[str, Any]`, and an AST rule that bans one loop spelling only protects syntax.

**Rule:**
- Parse external data once, retain the closed domain value through every semantic operation, and
  serialize only at the artifact/UI boundary: **parse → retain → aggregate → serialize**.
- Model measured/incomplete/empty as variants. Put numeric rates only on the measured variant, so
  an unavailable rate is absent by construction rather than represented by a sentinel number.
- Give every aggregation surface the same typed owner. Overall, per-cell, per-polarity, and
  per-query summaries must not each re-derive coverage.
- Use `ty` on proof-carrying islands first. Expand the island when a raw boundary is replaced; do
  not make the whole legacy repository pass by adding `Any` or broad ignores.
- Prefer model-gap and reversion tests: construct incomplete evidence and prove no rate exists, the
  terminal calls it incomplete, and the CLI exits nonzero. A test that only checks a false pass bit
  repeats the bug's assumption.
- Treat source/AST guards as migration scaffolding for facts the language cannot express, not as
  the primary architecture. If a sum type and API ownership can encode the rule, use them.

## 2026-07-31 — A registry is a constructor, not a bag of names

**Problem:** Adding one backend used to require coordinated edits to capability, answer, trigger,
judge, workspace, trace, smoke, failure-marker, and provider-CLI registries. The history of the
Agy integration showed the predictable result: one commit added the broad wiring, later commits
repaired individual surfaces, and reviewers had to rediscover which copies were authoritative.

The first unified registry still had weaker versions of the same escape. A non-native route could
exist without executable command ownership; a second export/import row could reuse Jetty commands;
lazy references could resolve to objects with the wrong runtime shape; frozen rows could retain
mutable lists; and Python annotations admitted `1` as a boolean plus open telemetry vocabularies.
Direct script execution could also import a second copy of the defining module and split mutable
compatibility state.

**Lesson:** A registry becomes architecture only when constructing one complete row proves its
declaration policy and materializing that row proves its executable contracts. A mapping that
merely collects names centralizes lookup, not correctness. `frozen=True`, type annotations, and a
valid import path are useful declarations, but none is runtime validation.

**Rule:**
- Give each backend row one stable identity and ownership of its answer route and commands,
  answer/trigger/judge bindings, workspace, trace, smoke, failure policy, capability/telemetry
  declarations, and provider CLI options. Adding a key to a derived dictionary is replacement,
  not registration.
- Validate in two stages. Construction closes routes, command ownership, nested tuple shapes,
  exact booleans, and scalar vocabularies; materialization resolves lazy references and checks
  answer, trigger, judge, workspace, and trace runtime shapes before publishing any view.
- Treat deep immutability as a boundary property. A frozen dataclass that captures a list is still
  mutable, and `bool` fields must reject integers even though `True == 1`.
- Use lazy references to keep the registry acyclic, then preserve one canonical module identity
  for direct-script and installed entrypoints so the same references cannot resolve into parallel
  class and registry instances.
- Keep compatibility maps only as explicit replacement seams for tests and integrations. Policy
  projections stay immutable, and conformance tests fail if another registration point appears.
- Audit the model gap, not only current rows: construct a complete synthetic future backend and
  adversarial malformed rows, verify the negative tests fail when guards are removed, then rerun
  import-order, direct-entrypoint, CLI-collision, full-suite, and documentation-drift checks.

## 2026-07-31 — A provider boundary includes every configuration authority

**Problem:** The first Gemini adapter isolated `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` and appended a harness policy, but
Gemini also accepts authority from command-option aliases, environment variables, workspace
`.env` files, `.agents/skills`, sessions, extensions, additional directories, user policy, and
administrator policy. Exact-token collision checks missed `--flag=value`, attached short aliases,
and `--admin-policy`. Auth isolation independently combined “an auth-looking environment variable
exists” with a copied `selectedType`, even though Gemini chooses a configured type before its
environment selector. The result could be either weaker isolation or a home that could not
authenticate.
The audit also found that Gemini authenticates a second time inside container
sandboxes. Legacy OAuth files and explicit ADC are portable, while GCA access tokens,
encrypted FileKeychain state, keychain-only API keys, and implicit metadata auth are not; a sandbox flag
can therefore make an otherwise valid auth plan fail. Free-form executable
prefixes could reconstruct stripped environment controls or swallow appended
policy flags, and invalid UTF-8 could fail before artifacts existed—or become a
replacement character inside otherwise valid JSON.

**Lesson:** A temporary home is only one tier of a CLI's control plane. Correct construction needs
one closed invocation plan covering argv, environment, workspace, user state, machine state, auth,
and the provider wire. Each tier must be either owned, rejected, isolated, or explicitly disclosed.

**Implications for PR #62:**

- Parse the official Gemini event union before deriving trigger evidence. Unknown, malformed,
  duplicate, non-finite, dangling, or unterminated streams are protocol failures, not negative
  trigger observations.
- Treat `activate_skill` as a real provider tool lifecycle. A start without a successful result is
  not activation; a failed result is not a completed tool call; consent denial is provider/process
  evidence, not “the skill chose not to trigger.”
- Keep search intent separate from file access. A `glob` or `grep_search` pattern containing
  `SKILL.md` proves only a query. Gemini's `read_many_files.include` also proves only intent:
  `stream-json` omits the processed-file list, so even a successful no-match glob cannot prove a
  real skill-file read.
- Do not advertise autonomous trigger support from discovery documentation alone. Require a live,
  headless, consent-free positive and negative activation proof under the exact policy used by the
  harness, and preserve “not measurable” until that gate passes.
- Build auth as one sum-type decision using Gemini's documented precedence. Credential-support
  variables such as `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` are not necessarily auth
  selectors, a copied setting can outrank environment inference, and the current shared keychain
  plus `GEMINI_FORCE_ENCRYPTED_FILE_STORAGE` and its file-storage sub-selector must travel together
  when the selected auth mode needs them. Explicit ADC belongs in the isolated credential home,
  never in the model-readable workspace (including through symlinks).
- Preserve exact provider bytes or an explicit lossless encoding in future artifact contracts. The
  current subprocess boundary retains an artifact-safe decoded representation plus a strict UTF-8
  validity bit; invalid transport is never promoted, but the original invalid bytes are not claimed
  as preserved. Record the upstream CLI commit/version used for fixtures, and ensure malformed
  traces still produce durable failure artifacts so #62 can diagnose the activation barrier.
- Keep provider errors, protocol errors, warnings, tool failures, and process exit as distinct
  states. Optional wire fields must remain optional even when a stricter invented invariant would
  make the parser look cleaner.
- Distinguish a harness preflight rejection from a provider exit. If no process was created, PR #62
  must persist a no-process observation rather than claiming a complete failed process.

**Recommendations for current and future integrations:**

- Add a provider-authority inventory to every adapter review: executable and aliases; environment;
  local/ancestor files; workspace discovery; user home; system/admin policy; extensions/plugins;
  sessions; additional roots; network endpoints; and telemetry export.
- Audit configuration timing as well as precedence. For Gemini, env-file discovery occurs before
  parsed `--skip-trust`; pre-setting trust therefore enabled an ancestor `.gemini/.env` even though
  the isolated settings ignored ordinary `.env` files.
- Replace permissive command-prefix assembly with a typed invocation-plan constructor. Prefer one
  caller-trusted executable token; otherwise define an exact launcher grammar rather than an
  interpreter blacklist. Normalize long `=`, negated, split, short, and attached spellings before
  collision checks, then redact from that same plan so validation and artifact disclosure cannot
  drift.
- Define a closed auth plan per provider: selected mode, source, required credential material,
  supporting environment, nested-sandbox transport, incompatibilities, and metadata provenance.
  Never infer precedence from “any credential variable is present,” and never leave an explicit
  credential path in the model workspace.
- Disable provider usage statistics in the isolated user settings and label that as a requested
  setting, not a proven effective value when machine administrator settings have higher precedence.
- Treat aggregate counters and lifecycle evidence as independent unless the provider documents an
  invariant. Gemini judging moved to `stream-json` so zero tools is checked from observed
  lifecycles; its aggregate counter remains a secondary signal, not a substitute for the stream.
- Give each provider tool a schema-specific trace adapter. Normalize lifecycle first, count only
  successful completions, preserve failed attempts as errors, and test false-positive as well as
  false-negative skill evidence.
- Model resolved model identity as zero/one/many. Preserve requested/configured identity separately;
  never collapse a fallback or multi-model run into a singular billed-model claim.
- Use two JSON boundaries deliberately: trusted/imported inputs may reject malformed strict JSON
  immediately, while provider failures must retain an artifact-safe representation with parse and
  UTF-8 diagnostics plus an incomplete evidence state. A future raw-byte artifact should use an
  explicit lossless encoding. Replacement decoding can silently turn malformed bytes into valid
  JSON strings and must never certify the trace.
- Make registry defaults construct programmatic invocations as well as argparse namespaces. Test
  each surface through both the CLI and direct Python API so a backend is not accidentally usable
  only from one route.
- Require a common conformance pack for every integration: answer, judge, trigger (when claimed),
  no-trigger, tool success/failure, warning/error, timeout/spawn/nonzero exit, missing telemetry,
  malformed/unknown wire, auth precedence, config isolation, option collisions, multi-model
  attribution, and durable failure artifacts.
- Gate capability claims with meaningful opt-in smoke tests. A smoke must exercise the integration's
  riskiest behavior (for Gemini, a real completed skill-file read under the harness policy) and
  record the installed CLI version, not merely obtain a zero process exit.
- Layer live evidence instead of treating “smoke tested” as a boolean: verify the installed
  executable and flags, the unauthenticated/auth-failure boundary, a token-backed semantic answer,
  and positive/negative autonomous activation separately. The first two can prove command and
  failure-path compatibility without credentials; they cannot substitute for the latter two.
- Generate or guard provider inventories in documentation from the registry, and periodically
  re-harvest official fixtures against a pinned upstream revision. Provider CLIs evolve too quickly
  for copied prose and one-time schema assumptions to remain trustworthy unaided.
- Continue migrating the residual provider invocation dictionaries to a shared closed result union.
  The current typed answer, judge, trace, and artifact boundaries contain the risk, but eliminating
  the local dictionary seam would let type checking enforce the same state model end to end.
- Treat preprocessing as part of the provider wire. Gemini expands active `@path` references before
  the model/tool-policy loop and does not expose that file ingestion as a `stream-json` tool event.
  It also dispatches leading slash commands before normal prompting. The harness now rejects both
  forms before spawn; PR #62 must apply the same rule or explicitly model preprocessing evidence.
- Carry the explicit process-state discriminant into judge invocations too. The current answer and
  trigger contracts distinguish timeout/spawn from real exits 124/127, while `JudgeInvocation`
  still has only a numeric return code and is therefore not yet an equally suitable lifecycle type.
- Prefer signal-specific telemetry provenance types. A single closed vocabulary is better than a
  free string, but it can still admit nonsensical combinations such as price-table provenance for
  elapsed time unless each signal constrains its own subset.
- Make prompt transport an invocation-plan capability. Gemini and Vibe currently place prompts in
  argv, which can expose content in local process listings and hit OS command-line size limits;
  prefer stdin or a protected prompt file when a provider offers equivalent noninteractive semantics.

## 2026-08-01 — Typed islands are coherent only when their proofs compose

**Problem:** Each layer of the typed-boundary stack could be locally valid while adjacent layers
still disagreed about meaning. Early revisions paired rows by Python object identity, represented a
zero-exit provider failure as a fabricated process exit, allowed a metric to average the survivors
of an otherwise complete cohort, and coupled telemetry availability to grading eligibility. Frozen
containers and warning-free annotations did not make those cross-boundary claims true.

**Lesson:** A type is useful evidence only when stable value identity, lifecycle ownership,
coverage refinement, and serialization semantics survive all the way to the decision that consumes
it. `ty` can prove that consumers handle the model we expose; it cannot repair a model whose owner
or distinctions are wrong.

**Rule:**
- Give comparisons stable value identities. Pair by explicit case/model/repetition/population and
  canonical contrast coordinates; never use object identity or treatment labels as repetition
  identity.
- Give each fact one owner. Process creation and exit, provider completion, trace evidence, judge
  verdict, artifact durability, and report coverage are separate axes; one axis cannot fabricate or
  upgrade another.
- Preserve wire distinctions exactly. Schema versions are JSON integers, not booleans or integral
  floats; absent and present-with-`null` are different when the schema says so; recursively freeze
  accepted payloads before publishing them.
- Make coverage refinement monotone. A complete row cohort can become partial for a specific
  metric, but filtering or a later projection cannot resurrect an unavailable headline. Telemetry
  remains independently observable even when a row is not grade-eligible.
- Keep compatibility at one named seam. Preserve meaningful legacy values such as inherited stdin
  (`None`) and explicit numeric zero rather than normalizing them through truthiness.
- Pair static proofs with runtime model-gap tests. Narrowing and exhaustiveness belong in `ty`;
  malformed wires, semantic contradictions, persistence round trips, and reversion failures belong
  in executable tests.

## 2026-08-01 — Every PR in a stack is a release candidate

**Problem:** A green top-of-stack branch can hide a broken intermediate tip, a description that
depends on code introduced later, or a child diff whose base changed after its parent merged. Those
failures make the advertised review boundary fictional even when the final combined tree is sound.

**Lesson:** A stacked PR is a sequence of independently reviewable and independently green changes,
not one large change split into GitHub pages. Merge order and base movement are part of the change's
correctness protocol.

**Rule:**
- Make each PR target its immediate predecessor and state its parent, scope, risk, and standalone
  validation. No layer may require a later PR to compile, test, or explain its public behavior.
- Test every intermediate tip with the full deterministic suite. Audit both directions: lower
  layers for contracts leaked upward, and upper layers for duplicated ownership or weakened
  semantics.
- Before restacking, preserve a backup ref. If a prerequisite was squash-merged, transplant the
  stack onto the exact merged tree, inspect every resulting diff, and rerun every tip's checks.
- When GitHub recognizes a native stack, mark every included PR ready and green, then request the
  asynchronous merge on the highest intended tip and poll its UUID. GitHub merges every ancestor up
  to that tip into the base branch; the ordinary synchronous merge endpoint is not valid for a
  recognized stack.
- If the native stack endpoint is unavailable, merge strictly from the base upward: after each
  parent, retarget or rebase only the next child, inspect the diff, and wait for its checks. Do not
  delete an intermediate base before its child has the correct target.
- Treat inventories according to meaning: packaging, static-analysis coverage, and causal identity
  are different sets. A stack-wide guard should enforce their relationship, not collapse them into
  filesystem equality.
