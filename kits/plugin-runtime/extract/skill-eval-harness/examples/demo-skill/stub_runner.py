"""Deterministic stub 'model' for the demo eval — no network, no API key.

run-codex copies the (real or ablated) skill tree into an isolated workspace and
runs this with that workspace as the cwd. We answer by keying off the skill content
that is actually mounted, so:

  - with_skill            -> both load-bearing pieces present  -> both assertions pass
  - ablation:no-severity  -> '## Severity rules' section removed -> severity label missing -> regression
  - ablation:no-checklist -> references/checklist.md blanked    -> file/line citation missing -> regression
  - without_skill         -> nothing mounted                   -> both assertions fail

That makes the materialized ablations produce a real, confirmable regression with
zero model calls — the example runs in CI.
