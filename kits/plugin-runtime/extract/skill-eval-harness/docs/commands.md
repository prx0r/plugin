# Command reference

Every `skill-benchmark` subcommand, plus the `skill-pi-trigger-eval` and
`skill-trigger-matrix` entry points. The README carries the [core loop](../README.md#core-loop)
and a grouped [command index](../README.md#commands); this file is the per-command detail.

Contracts and safety rules that span commands live elsewhere: the manifest shape and
the run-output contract are in the [README](../README.md#manifest-format), the assertion
catalog is the [README's Assertions section](../README.md#assertions), and the reason
grading never calls a model is [`architecture.md`](architecture.md).

## Inspect agent capabilities

```bash
skill-benchmark agent-capabilities
skill-benchmark agent-capabilities --out backend-registry.json
```

`agent-capabilities` renders the unified `agent_capabilities.BACKENDS` rows as
JSON: capability and telemetry contracts, explicit answer route and executable
command entrypoints, native answer/trigger/judge bindings, trace dialect, and
live-smoke policy. Serialization does not dereference lazy handlers or trace
implementations, and the command does not invoke provider implementations or
CLIs; normal CLI import
still materializes the compatibility implementation views.

## Validate

```bash
skill-benchmark validate ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json
skill-benchmark validate ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --strict-holdback
skill-benchmark validate ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --strict-leakage
```

`validate` checks manifest shape, fixture paths, regex syntax, script oracle paths, and hidden-prompt refs. It also warns when a `contains*` assertion value appears literally in the prompt:

```text
WARN pos-ui-no-screenshot: assertion 'detect-ui-no-screenshot' value 'screenshot' appears in prompt (leakage; case may saturate)
```

That warning means a weak answer can pass by echoing the task. Use `--strict-leakage` only after you have replaced noisy keyword checks with scoped regexes, fixture-backed checks, `script` oracles, or judge assertions.

## Prepare tasks

```bash
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --runs-per-variant 5 --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --include-ablations --ablation-dir ablated-skills --out ablation-tasks.jsonl
```

`--include-ablations` requires `--ablation-dir DIR` whenever any ablation declares a removal (a `mechanism`/`components` + `target`): the altered skill tree is materialized there and the prepared rows point at it. (A manifest with only instruction-simulated ablations does not need it.)

Use `--include-answer-key` only for judge/debug tasks, never for generation runs.

## Import runner traces

Normalize a raw JSONL trace into `events.json` and `metrics.json` for process and efficiency assertions:

```bash
skill-benchmark import-trace \
  --source codex \
  --trace ../repo/eval-runs/latest/case/with_skill/run-1/trace.jsonl \
  --run-dir ../repo/eval-runs/latest/case/with_skill/run-1 \
  --write-metadata
```

## Run Codex JSONL tasks

`run-codex` is a compatibility wrapper for `run-agent --agent codex`. It executes prepared rows through a command compatible with `codex exec --json`, adds `--output-last-message <file>` for final-answer capture, saves JSONL as `trace.jsonl`, normalizes events/metrics, runs with isolated `CODEX_HOME` outside the model workdir, and records nonzero/timeouts as failed run artifacts. The shared subprocess owner observes CLI-leader exit independently of inherited capture-pipe EOF, then terminates remaining members of the original process group on POSIX before bounded retry/backoff removes the isolated home. An escaped process cannot make pipe draining unbounded: POSIX capture descriptors are closed after a short grace period, while non-POSIX reader threads are abandoned and reported. Cleanup recovery or fallback is recorded in stderr and `environment.json` without replacing an already captured answer. Non-POSIX runs report process-group cleanup as unsupported while retaining bounded, non-throwing home cleanup:

```bash
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark run-codex --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/codex-tune
```

Override `--codex-cmd` for local wrappers or tests. It is an argv-style command prefix parsed with `shlex.split`; shell metacharacters, pipes, and inline env assignments are not interpreted. Put those in a wrapper script and pass the wrapper path instead.

```bash
skill-benchmark run-codex \
  --tasks tasks.jsonl \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/codex-trace \
  --codex-cmd ./bin/codex-jsonl-wrapper
```

## Run native agent tasks

`run-agent` is the provider-neutral native runner. It dispatches prepared rows through a registered backend and writes the same run contract as the compatibility wrappers:

```bash
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark run-agent --agent codex --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/codex-tune \
  --model openai/gpt-5.4-mini
skill-benchmark run-agent --agent claude --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/claude-tune \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
skill-benchmark run-agent --agent gemini --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/gemini-tune \
  --model gemini-2.5-flash
```

The Gemini backend invokes the official CLI in headless `stream-json` mode and
accepts final text only from a complete typed stream. It creates a fresh
`GEMINI_CLI_HOME` outside the task workspace, copies only minimal auth state,
rejects workspace `.gemini`, `.agents`, `.geminiignore`, and `GEMINI.md`
controls case-insensitively, requests sandboxing when the selected credentials
can cross Gemini's nested sandbox boundary, and
loads a deny-all policy with a higher-priority allowlist for the five read-only
tools used by answer runs. `--gemini-cmd` accepts exactly one caller-trusted
executable path; free-form launcher/prefix arguments are rejected. Artifacts
record the sandbox/auth transport decision, installed `gemini --version`, and
pinned wire-fixture revision. Token stats are normalized when the CLI returns
them; missing token stats and unsupported dollar cost remain explicit `missing`.

## Run Claude tasks (with cost capture)

`run-claude` is a compatibility wrapper for `run-agent --agent claude`: it executes prepared rows through `claude -p --output-format stream-json --verbose`, extracts the answer from the stream's terminal `result` event into `output.md`, records real per-run `total_cost_usd` + token usage into `metrics.json`, and keeps the full stream as the run's raw trace — `trace.jsonl` verbatim, normalized tool-use events in `events.json` (a `tool_use` block opens a call, its `tool_result` completes it; an orphaned call counts zero), so process and efficiency assertions have evidence on Claude answer runs. The benchmark report then totals `cost_usd_total` per arm (over scorable runs), so a paired eval reports actual dollars:

```bash
skill-benchmark prepare ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --out tasks.jsonl
skill-benchmark run-claude --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs ../repo/eval-runs/claude-tune \
  --model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001
```

`--model` is optional (omit for the CLI default); `--claude-bin` overrides the executable (a stub in tests). A nonzero exit/timeout is written as a `[CLAUDE FAILURE …]` body, which `execution_valid` treats as a non-scorable infra failure, exactly like the Codex/Jetty runners.

## Run subagent tasks (in-process seam, tool replay, multi-turn)

`run-subagent` drives prepared rows through an in-process backend — the Claude CLI by default, any provider via `--agent-cmd` (prompt JSON on stdin, `{answer, trace?, usage?}` JSON on stdout), or a plain function in tests. It writes the same run-output contract (plus normalized `events.json`/`metrics.json` from a returned trace), reuses the isolated per-variant workspace (so the CF.2 baseline-isolation invariant covers it), honors row-level models, and drives multi-turn `turns` sequences into `turn-<n>/output.md`. Tool I/O can be recorded and replayed deterministically via `--tool-replay record|replay|strict|auto` (or `$SKILL_BENCHMARK_TOOL_REPLAY`), stored as `tool-replay.json` beside each run; `strict` fails closed on an unrecorded call.

```bash
skill-benchmark run-subagent --tasks tasks.jsonl --runs eval-runs/subagent --tool-replay record
```

## Compare judges (judge-sensitivity)

A single judge number is not reproducible across judge choice for a subtle skill. Judge the same runs with two models (`benchmark --judge-results` merges each), then `compare-judges` flags whether the measured lift depends on the judge:

```bash
skill-benchmark compare-judges \
  --report haiku=benchmark.haiku.json \
  --report sonnet=benchmark.sonnet.json \
  --out judge-panel.json
```

It reports each judge's `with_skill − without_skill` combined lift and sets `sign_sensitive` (judges disagree the skill helps), `magnitude_sensitive` (lift spread > `--magnitude-eps`, default 0.1), and `judge_sensitive` (either). Needs ≥2 `--report name=path`. Every verdict from `judge` carries its `judge_model`, so which model graded a run is always recoverable.

`compare-judges` asks *"does the result depend on which judge I picked?"* — not *"is the judge correct?"* For that, validate the judge against **human labels**:

## Validate a judge against human labels (judge-alignment)

Two judges can agree and both be wrong. `judge-alignment` scores a judge's verdicts against a human-labeled gold set (both keyed by `judge_task_id` with a `passed` bool), treating the human label as ground truth:

```bash
skill-benchmark judge-alignment \
  --labels human-labels.jsonl \
  --judge-results judge-results.jsonl \
  --out judge-alignment.json
```

It reports `agreement`, **Cohen's `cohen_kappa`** (chance-corrected, so an imbalanced label set can't flatter the judge) with a `kappa_interpretation` band, and `precision`/`recall`/`f1` plus the `confusion` matrix. Below `--min-labels` (default 50) matched labels it warns that the metrics are unstable. Fully model-free — it grades a judge you already ran.

The end-to-end calibration loop over this command, `compare-judges`, and `judge-robustness` — runnable offline on the demo — is [`can-i-trust-my-judge.md`](can-i-trust-my-judge.md).

## Error analysis (open coding → axial taxonomy)

`error-analysis` turns a `benchmark.json` into the "look at your data" surface: an open-coding **review queue** (one row per failing/errored run, anchored on its *first* upstream failure, with an open `note` slot) and an axial **failure taxonomy** (first-failures counted by category, so the few dominant buckets are visible), alongside the report's own case-flag histogram. Model-free.

```bash
skill-benchmark error-analysis --benchmark benchmark.json --out error-analysis.json
```

## Pi trace runners

The Adewale Pi smoke example writes the trace-aware run layout directly:

```bash
python3 examples/adewale-workspace/run_pi_smoke.py \
  --run-name trace-smoke \
  --selection /tmp/selection.json
```

The runner uses an isolated temporary workspace. `with_skill` receives copied skill files and fixtures. `without_skill` receives fixtures only and runs with `--no-skills`, so grep/find/read cannot discover the source repo's `skills/*/SKILL.md` or public eval manifests.

`skill-pi-trigger-eval` can also write per-query trace artifacts:

```bash
skill-pi-trigger-eval ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --eval-set trigger-queries.json \
  --out trigger-results.json \
  --trace-runs trigger-traces
```

## Grade

`grade` produces per-run grading rows and can emit pending judge tasks:

```bash
skill-benchmark grade ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --out grade-report.json \
  --judge-tasks judge-tasks.jsonl
```

Write Anthropic-compatible `grading.json` files into each run directory:

```bash
skill-benchmark grade ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --write-grading-files
```

## Benchmark

`benchmark` aggregates graded rows into variant summaries, paired deltas (with sign-flip `significance` and a `graded` channel), per-model grouping (`by_model`, `model_analysis` ranking and lift losers), slice summaries with lift concentration, oracle-strength shares, held-out vs tune-visible qualitative rates, and case flags. Add `--allow-scripts` only when you trust the repo-owned oracle commands in the manifest; `--strict` promotes soft assertions to gates; `--embed-cmd` enables embedding-mode similarity.

```bash
skill-benchmark benchmark ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --allow-scripts \
  --judge-results judge-results.jsonl \
  --out benchmark.json
```

Multi-model runs prepare with `--models a,b,c` (run dirs gain a model segment: `<case>/<model>/<variant>`); grading discovers both layouts and pairs lift per (case, model).

## CI report formats

`report` serializes a `benchmark.json` for CI: `--format junit` writes one `<testcase>` per case/variant/run with evidence on failures and the paired lift as suite properties; `--format github` writes job-summary markdown plus `::warning` annotations per flagged case (and an `::error` on negative lift).

```bash
skill-benchmark report --benchmark benchmark.json --format junit --out junit.xml
skill-benchmark report --benchmark benchmark.json --format github --out "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
```

The full CI gating recipe — both report formats plus the manifest-trust gate — is [`gating-ci-on-evals.md`](gating-ci-on-evals.md).

## Trend, staleness, and harder-case suggestions

`trend` keeps an append-only history of benchmark reports and emits the series, successive diffs, recurring failures ranked by prevalence x severity, and prune candidates (cases that never failed and never discriminated across the history — suggestions only, nothing is deleted). `suggest-cases` turns saturated/no-lift flags into harder-case candidate seeds; generation is opt-in behind `--generate-cmd` and never edits a manifest.

```bash
skill-benchmark trend --history eval-history --add benchmark.json --out trend.json
skill-benchmark suggest-cases --benchmark benchmark.json --manifest evals/shared-benchmark.json --out candidates.json
```

## Migrate a manifest

`migrate` upgrades a version-1 manifest to version 2: stamps default severities and oracle tiers, marks binary judge rubrics with a `graded?` todo, prints the diff plus the judgment-call checklist (`--check` for a dry run, `--out-checklist` to save it). See [`migrating-evals.md`](migrating-evals.md) for the agent runbook.

## Judge backends

Run deferred `judge`/`rubric` assertions with either a native backend (`--judge-backend claude`, `--judge-backend codex`, `--judge-backend gemini`, or `--judge-backend vibe`) or a shell command (`--judge-cmd`) that reads one grading prompt from stdin and emits JSON on stdout. The prompt contains the original case prompt, `expected_behavior`, `review_rubric`, the assertion, and the saved candidate output.

```bash
skill-benchmark judge ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-backend claude \
  --judge-model claude-haiku-4-5-20251001 \
  --transcripts judge-transcripts \
  --out judge-results.jsonl

skill-benchmark judge ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-backend codex \
  --judge-model openai/gpt-5.4-mini \
  --transcripts judge-transcripts-codex \
  --out judge-results.codex.jsonl

skill-benchmark judge ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-backend vibe \
  --judge-model mistral-large-latest \
  --transcripts judge-transcripts-vibe \
  --out judge-results.vibe.jsonl

skill-benchmark judge ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-backend gemini \
  --judge-model gemini-2.5-flash \
  --transcripts judge-transcripts-gemini \
  --out judge-results.gemini.jsonl

skill-benchmark judge ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-cmd 'claude -p' \
  --transcripts judge-transcripts \
  --out judge-results.jsonl

skill-benchmark benchmark ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-results judge-results.jsonl \
  --out benchmark.json
```

Native Claude uses `claude -p --output-format json --no-session-persistence`; tool-free judges add `--tools ""`, and every native Claude judge passes the harness verdict schema through `--json-schema`. Native Codex uses isolated `CODEX_HOME` outside the model workdir plus `codex exec --output-last-message <file> --output-schema <schema.json>` so verdict parsing reads the final assistant message rather than the event JSONL stream. Native Gemini uses isolated `GEMINI_CLI_HOME`, `--output-format stream-json`, conditional nested sandboxing, and a deny-all tool policy; only the stream's final validated assistant segment reaches verdict parsing, while the raw lifecycle stream and session/model metadata are saved as transcript sidecars. It rejects observed tool lifecycles and nonzero aggregate tool counts. Native Vibe uses isolated `VIBE_HOME` outside the model workdir plus `vibe --prompt "$PROMPT" --output json` with tools disabled (`--enabled-tools re:^$`) and reads the final assistant message as the verdict JSON; `--judge-model` is passed through `VIBE_ACTIVE_MODEL`. Native judges run from an explicit working directory: a sanitized run-copy when tool exploration is enabled, otherwise a fresh empty temp directory so they cannot accidentally read the harness repo cwd. For Codex/OpenAI structured output, the harness adapts the canonical verdict schema into a strict provider schema (`additionalProperties:false`; optional fields become nullable) while still validating the returned verdict against the canonical schema. Gemini and Vibe do not expose provider-enforced schema here, so harness-side schema validation is the gate. A shell judge command should return JSON like `{"passed": true, "score": 4, "rationale": "..."}`. Bare or fenced JSON is accepted using `json.raw_decode` scanning rather than brace counting. `--transcripts` saves the exact prompt, stdout, stderr, parsed result, and any provider response/metadata sidecars.

## Audit manifest quality

```bash
skill-benchmark audit-manifest ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --format markdown \
  --out eval-audit.md
```

Add `--runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest` to include saturated-case, no-lift, flaky repeated-run, and per-assertion discrimination analysis.

The audit reports:

- a **readiness** verdict — "is this eval worth paying to run?" — collapsing the things that decide whether a measured number will mean anything: ablations materialized vs instruction-simulated, **leak-saturated cases** (every positive objective assertion's value already appears in the prompt, so `with_skill == without_skill` by construction), adversarial coverage, and **objective-only cases** (a behaviour case with no judge assertion can only ever measure objective compliance — if the skill's value is voice/judgement it will read as zero lift). With `--runs`, it also surfaces the signals a static manifest can't see: **base-saturated cases** (measured `with_skill == without_skill` — a blocker, the case measures nothing) and **qualitative-only cases** (objective flat but the combined/judge score lifts — the skill's value is qualitative). All with an explicit `blockers` punch list;
- missing positive, negative, and adversarial eval coverage,
- missing holdout/holdback split coverage,
- missing trigger/no-trigger coverage,
- missing domain/difficulty/success-goal taxonomy for slice summaries,
- ablation-plan suggestions from major skill sections,
- the instruction-simulated ablations that should be materialized (and dangling/unknown ablation references),
- saturated and no-lift cases when run data is available,
- assertions with identical with/without pass rates, and
- recommended fixture repos/files.

**Gate it in CI.** `--fail-on-blockers` makes `audit-manifest` exit non-zero when the readiness block has any blockers, so a skill repo can keep its eval suite at "worth paying to run" the same way it keeps tests green:

```bash
skill-benchmark audit-manifest evals/shared-benchmark.json --fail-on-blockers
```

The systematic way to upgrade a suite is to drive those blockers to empty, repo by repo: materialize the ablations (`materialize-ablations` / declare a `mechanism`+`target`), de-leak the leak-saturated cases (move the answer out of the prompt, or assert a downstream consequence), and add adversarial cases where missing — then the gate goes green. The walkthrough is [`gating-ci-on-evals.md`](gating-ci-on-evals.md).

## Contamination perimeter (output-side, model-free)

```bash
skill-benchmark contamination ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --model-cutoff 2025-01 \
  --fail-on-contamination \
  --out contamination.json
```

Three model-free checks over saved outputs: a canary tripwire (a case's declared canary string appearing through the `rendered-v1` human-text view), output↔answer-key n-gram containment through that same view (`--ngram`, flagged above `--overlap-threshold`), and a `released_at`-vs-`--model-cutoff` gate for cases the model may have seen in training. `--fail-on-contamination` makes it a CI gate.

## Judge robustness probes

```bash
skill-benchmark judge-robustness ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --judge-model claude-sonnet-4-6 \
  --fail-on-findings \
  --out judge-robustness.json
```

Probes a judge's stability before you trust its verdicts (model-touching; opt-in): order-flip self-consistency plus empty-output and master-key negative controls a robust judge must reject. Takes the same `--judge-cmd`/`--judge-model` backends as `judge`; `--fail-on-findings` makes it a CI gate.

## Cost telemetry (tokens and dollars)

Cost is a first-class eval signal. Every runner path — Pi smoke, Pi trigger, `run-codex`, `run-claude`, `run-subagent`, the judge wrapper, and the Jetty importer — writes legacy-compatible normalized blocks beside raw provider fields **and** an availability-aware telemetry v3 envelope into both `metadata.json` and `metrics.json`.

- `usage_normalized`: alias-normalized token counts (`input`/`prompt_tokens`/`totalTokens`/cache/reasoning variants) with a `source` — `provider_reported` (relayed from the provider), `trace_normalized` (summed from normalized trace events), `estimated`, `missing`, or `not_applicable`.
- `cost_normalized`: legacy-compatible dollar block with `currency`, per-part costs, and a source. Its v3 counterpart separates provenance (`provider_reported`, `trace_normalized`, `price_table_estimated`, or `legacy_unverified`) from availability (`available`, `unavailable`, or `not_applicable`). A measured `$0` is available; unknown cost is never zero.

Consumers of the blocks:

- `benchmark`/`aggregate` emit `cost_summary`: availability-aware coverage and operational totals (**every run counts here, including execution errors — a timed-out run still cost money — while quality rates keep excluding them**). A mixed set renders a partial known subtotal, not a false total. Per-variant stats, per-case spend, paired deltas, ablation marginal cost, and judge spend retain their basis/provenance.
- `cost-summary` writes the standalone suite ledger (`--out cost-summary.json`, `--md cost-summary.md`): coverage, totals, by variant/case/runner, top expensive cases and ablation arms, and `cost_quality_findings` when a `--benchmark` report is joined.
- `suite-run` projects spend **before any model call** from previous ledgers (`--cost-history <dir>`, per-run medians) or a static assumption (`--assumed-tokens-per-run`), and gates on `--max-estimated-tokens` / `--max-estimated-cost-usd` — failing closed when a dollar cap is set but no dollar estimate exists — unless `--allow-over-budget`.
- `audit-manifest --runs` adds cost-quality findings above `--expensive-case-usd` (default $1): `expensive-saturated-case`, `expensive-no-lift-case`, `high-cost-judge-only-case`, `ablation-high-spend-no-structured-regression`, and `high-footprint-low-lift-skill`.

Interpretation rule: `provider_reported` numbers are a direct provider envelope; `trace_normalized` reconstructs usage or cost from event streams; `unavailable` means the run carried no usable telemetry — fix the runner path rather than treating it as free. Lift-per-dollar is emitted only for scorable, basis-compatible paired costs with a strictly positive incremental cost; otherwise JSON/Markdown report a blocked reason. The complete contract and migration policy are in [`telemetry-availability-and-comparability-spec.md`](telemetry-availability-and-comparability-spec.md).

```bash
skill-benchmark cost-summary \
  --manifest ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --benchmark benchmark.json \
  --out cost-summary.json \
  --md cost-summary.md
```

Upgrade existing run directories without guessing provenance:

```bash
skill-benchmark migrate-telemetry --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest --check
skill-benchmark migrate-telemetry --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest
```

The first command is byte-preserving; the second atomically adds schema v3 envelopes and any missing sibling artifact. Legacy numeric values are labelled `legacy_unverified` and do not qualify for causal lift-per-dollar comparisons.

## Profile skill size and references

```bash
skill-benchmark profile-skill ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --format markdown \
  --out skill-profile.md
```

`profile-skill` reports `SKILL.md` token estimates, reference-file counts/sizes, heading/module counts, and warnings for overly broad or oversized skills. These warnings are advisory; focused 2–3-module skills are often easier for agents to apply, but large skills can be justified when references are conditional.

## Token overhead

`token-overhead` combines static skill profile data with paired runtime traces. It reports the static `SKILL.md`/reference footprint, `with_skill - without_skill` token deltas, objective lift, objective lift per 1k extra total tokens — and, when cost telemetry exists, `with - without` dollar deltas, objective lift per dollar, and the total spend on saturated/no-lift pairs.

```bash
skill-benchmark token-overhead ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs-subdir eval-runs/latest \
  --format markdown \
  --out token-overhead.md

skill-benchmark token-overhead \
  ../skill-a/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  ../skill-b/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs-subdir eval-runs/trace-smoke \
  --out token-overhead.json
```

If a repo has no paired trace metrics, the report still includes the static footprint and shows `0` runtime pairs. The decision loop that reads these numbers is [`is-my-skill-worth-its-tokens.md`](is-my-skill-worth-its-tokens.md).

## Suite preflight / allowlisted multi-skill tiers

Use `suite-run` before expensive model calls. It reads only an explicit suite file, rejects unrelated top-level manifests under the workspace root, verifies optional tree-hash pins, prints row estimates, and writes `RUN_SCOPE.json`.

```bash
skill-benchmark suite-run examples/adewale-workspace/all-manifests.txt \
  --workspace-root ../updating_all_of_my_skills \
  --pins examples/skill-pins.json \
  --tier preflight \
  --out-dir suite-runs/preflight

skill-benchmark suite-run examples/adewale-workspace/all-manifests.txt \
  --workspace-root ../updating_all_of_my_skills \
  --pins examples/skill-pins.json \
  --tier prepare \
  --include-ablations \
  --out-dir suite-runs/prepare
```

Non-model tiers are `preflight`, `static`, `prepare`, and `jetty-dry-run`. By default, a stray manifest such as `beautiful-mermaid/evals/shared-benchmark.json` fails the run instead of silently entering the matrix; pass `--allow-extra-manifests` only for exploratory audits.

## Aggregate many skills

```bash
skill-benchmark aggregate \
  $(cat examples/adewale-workspace/all-manifests.txt) \
  --runs-root .. \
  --runs-subdir eval-runs/latest \
  --out aggregate-benchmark.json
```

## Export Anthropic-compatible benchmark

```bash
skill-benchmark export-anthropic ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --out benchmark.anthropic.json
```

## Blind comparison

```bash
skill-benchmark compare-tasks ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --out compare-tasks.jsonl \
  --truth-out compare-truth.json

skill-benchmark compare-results \
  --truth compare-truth.json \
  --results compare-results.jsonl \
  --out compare-summary.json
```

## Materialize ablations

`materialize-ablations` writes real, altered skill trees for the manifest's declared removal ablations, plus a provenance record. The mechanism table and correctness gates are [`skill-ablation-spec.md`](skill-ablation-spec.md); the [README's Ablations section](../README.md#ablations) covers routing.

```bash
skill-benchmark materialize-ablations ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --out-dir ablated --out ablated/provenance.json
```

## Review viewer (static or served)

```bash
skill-benchmark render-viewer \
  --benchmark benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/latest \
  --out review.html
```

The viewer embeds run artifacts (images inline, typed links for pdf/xlsx, text in place). `--previous-workspace <dir>` embeds a diff against that iteration's `benchmark.json` (per-variant deltas, per-case deltas, new/resolved flags; pair with the `iteration-N/` directory convention). `--serve --port 8642` hosts the review with a feedback form persisting to `feedback.json` (entries keyed by case/variant/run).

## Trigger matrix (activation across agents and models)

```bash
skill-trigger-matrix ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --agent claude \
  --runs-per-query 3 \
  --out trigger-matrix.json
```

For each (agent, model) cell this mounts the skill where that agent discovers skills autonomously (never forcing the load), runs the manifest's `kind: "trigger"` cases the requested number of times, and reports per-cell trigger rates split by should-fire / should-not-fire polarity. The `claude` adapter spawns headless Claude Code subagents and defaults to haiku, sonnet, and opus; `--agent codex`, `--agent pi`, `--agent vibe`, and the offline `--agent stub` are included. Codex keeps credential-bearing `CODEX_HOME` outside the model workdir and exposes only `$CODEX_HOME/skills` as an extra read root. The Vibe adapter mounts skills under `.agents/skills`, keeps `VIBE_HOME` outside the model workdir, runs `vibe --prompt "$QUERY" --output streaming`, and detects native `skill` tool calls by skill name with path-evidence fallback. Additional agents add their `AgentAdapter`, explicit trace-dialect semantics, and one complete `agent_capabilities.BACKENDS` row; `AGENT_CAPABILITIES` and `ADAPTERS` are projections rather than independent registration points. The tuning loop that consumes these rates is [`tuning-skill-activation.md`](tuning-skill-activation.md); manual live smoke tests wrap the same path (`RUN_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1` for Claude, `RUN_CODEX_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1` for Codex, `RUN_PI_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1` for Pi, `RUN_VIBE_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1` for Vibe). For a cheaper auth/network/process check that invokes every supported live adapter/model without asserting trigger behavior, run `RUN_AGENT_INVOKE_SMOKE=1 python3 -m unittest tests.test_trigger_matrix.AgentInvokeSmokeTests -v`.

## Pi trigger evals

```bash
skill-pi-trigger-eval ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --split tune \
  --runs-per-query 3 \
  --out trigger-report.json
```

This creates a temporary `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, copies the skill under `skills/`, runs Pi without forced `--skill`, and detects whether the model loaded the skill from JSON stream events. It is the deeper Pi-specific tool: discovery-population ablation arms, per-query trace artifacts, and cost telemetry.

## Trigger comparison (paired causal evidence for activation)

A single trigger-matrix report is a raw single-arm measurement — it steers description edits, but it cannot confirm that an ablation *caused* a discovery regression. `trigger-compare` pairs a baseline matrix report with an `--ablation` matrix report of the **same canonical skill revision** and emits the trigger population's version of the answer path's causal-confirmation verdict:

```bash
skill-trigger-matrix evals/shared-benchmark.json --agent claude --out baseline.json
skill-trigger-matrix evals/shared-benchmark.json --agent claude --ablation drop-description --out ablated.json
skill-benchmark trigger-compare --baseline baseline.json --ablation ablated.json --out trigger-comparison.json
```

Rows are re-validated through the typed trigger-observation contract (a row whose stored flags contradict the contract is rejected, never averaged). Reports declare the complete expected agent/model/query design, and every repetition carries a stable `(query_id, run_number)`: a missing whole cell, a short or duplicate repetition set, or a row outside the design makes the report malformed. Each report also carries a self-digested `manifest_identity`, a self-digested experimental `protocol` (producer/adapter and executable identities, model/flags, timeout, repetition count, and worker concurrency), and each row repeats the protocol digest plus observed isolation state. Missing or mismatched identity/protocol fields are a compatibility error; regenerate legacy reports with the current runner rather than comparing them. Cross-arm protocol or observed-isolation drift makes causal provenance unverified or blocks the affected cell.

Comparison then forms complete (agent, model, query-ID) cells and collapses every agent/model cell for the same authored query ID and polarity into one **pass-rate** delta. The authored query is the inference unit: adding models or agents cannot multiply one query into significance. Pass rates make polarity inherent, so a should-not-trigger query regresses by over-triggering. The verdict goes through the `EvidenceClass` guard: `confirmed_causal` requires matching top-level and recorded ablation IDs, verified revision provenance, complete coverage with no blocked cells, a negative aggregate mean pass delta, and a sign-flip-significant drop across authored queries (≥ 6 consistently regressed queries, same discretization bound as the answer path). A negative but insignificant mean reports `indeterminate`; a non-negative mean cannot confirm a regression even if the two-sided test is significant. Cross-arm design mismatches or incomplete observations are listed as blocked cells with reasons and make the whole verdict indeterminate.

## Jetty adapter

Jetty support is optional and validated against production `flows-api.jetty.io` (live smoke first passed 2026-07-17; captured response fixtures live in `tests/fixtures/jetty/` — see [`jetty-support-spec.md`](jetty-support-spec.md)). The harness exports runbook-mode chat-completion payloads, Jetty executes them, and `import-jetty-results` copies `output.md`, artifacts, and metadata back into the normal run layout. `run-jetty` zips each task's upload plan (Jetty's sandbox upload flattens single files to basenames; a zip auto-extracts under `/app/assets/` with paths preserved), submits with a short `timeout_hint` so polling drives the wait, and downloads every `/app/results` artifact from trajectory storage before writing the run record. Provider status aliases parse into queued/running/succeeded/failed/timed-out/protocol-invalid states; unknown status and completed-without-`output.md` fail closed as protocol-invalid rather than ordinary model failures. Imports validate every record, destination, embedded answer design, model-visible task digest, and uploaded-file digest before committing the batch; one invalid record leaves all destination run directories untouched.

Every live invocation requires `--out`, exclusively locks its attempt journal, and atomically checkpoints `prepared`, upload completion, submission acknowledgement, terminal provider observation, artifact download, and result publication. The default journal path is `<out>.attempts.json`; `--journal PATH` selects another location. Journal aliases resolve to one canonical identity, hard-linked journals and symlinked lock files are rejected, and the separate `<journal>.lock` file is intentionally retained while its OS lock is released automatically when the process exits or crashes. The identity contains the full attested task contract plus its digest, collection, task, and model, so a stale or mismatched receipt fails closed. Provider submit/poll responses are reduced to allowlisted causal receipts before persistence. Rerunning the same command resumes an acknowledged trajectory without another `POST /v1/chat/completions`, and a terminal receipt resumes download/import. A local polling deadline leaves the attempt acknowledged, emits a nonterminal record, exits nonzero, and is rejected by `import-jetty-results`; the next invocation polls the same ID again.

A process or connection failure, unusable acknowledgement, or HTTP status not documented as rejection-before-execution while the POST acknowledgement is pending becomes `submission_unknown`: it is visible in both the journal and result record, exits nonzero, cannot be imported, and is not retried. Only Jetty's documented 429 rejection returns to the automatically submit-ready state. After reconciling the provider manually, `--resubmit-unknown` explicitly abandons that unknown receipt and submits again. Jetty currently exposes no server-side idempotency key, so this override can duplicate a paid run; the harness deliberately does not claim exactly-once execution in that ambiguous window. Before replacing output on restart, the harness reconstructs every downloaded or committed record from the journal, so interruption cannot regress previously committed JSONL. File replacement is process-crash-safe on supported platforms; parent-directory syncing remains best-effort where the OS does not expose directory `fsync`.

```bash
# Export runbook-mode Jetty chat-completion payloads. No network calls.
skill-benchmark export-jetty ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --split tune \
  --out jetty-payloads.jsonl

# Dry-run payload loading without a token.
skill-benchmark run-jetty \
  --payloads jetty-payloads.jsonl \
  --dry-run \
  --out jetty-dry-run.jsonl

# Live execution requires JETTY_API_TOKEN.
export JETTY_API_TOKEN=...
skill-benchmark run-jetty \
  --payloads jetty-payloads.jsonl \
  --out jetty-runs.jsonl

# Import Jetty artifacts into the normal run layout, then grade locally.
skill-benchmark import-jetty-results \
  --manifest ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --jetty-runs jetty-runs.jsonl \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/jetty

skill-benchmark benchmark ../repo/evals/shared-benchmark.json \
  --runs ../repo/eval-runs/jetty \
  --out jetty-benchmark.json
```

Add `--journal jetty-attempts.json` when an explicit journal path is useful.
Do not use `--resubmit-unknown` until you have checked whether Jetty accepted
the ambiguous attempt.

Defaults follow Jetty docs and `jettyio/jettyio-skills`: `claude-code`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `model_provider=anthropic`, and `snapshot=python312-uv`. The runbook is the system message. Runtime values go in `jetty.template_variables`; every model-visible file reference is a deterministic `/app/assets/...` path baked at export time. `jetty.file_paths` carries the one run-time value — the uploaded zip bundle's storage path from `POST /api/v1/sandbox/upload`. Use `JETTY_BASE_URL` to override `https://flows-api.jetty.io`.

Opt-in live smoke (five real sandbox runs — fixture-free, fixture-backed, and a forced server-side failure; never in default CI):

```bash
RUN_JETTY_SMOKE=1 JETTY_API_TOKEN=... JETTY_SMOKE_COLLECTION=<your-collection> \
  python3 -m unittest discover tests -k smoke_jetty -v
```
