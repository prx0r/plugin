# Agent backend interface and parity spec

Status: implementation record for `spec/agent-backend-parity`.

This spec captures the shared adapter shape now used by Claude, Codex, Gemini CLI, and Mistral Vibe, the capability gaps each registry row reports explicitly, and the requirements for adding future coding agents without one-off command paths.

## Problem

The harness already treats saved run directories as the stable grading contract, but model execution still leaks provider-specific assumptions into several places:

- `run-claude` and `run-codex` are compatibility wrappers around a shared native `run-agent` path.
- `skill-trigger-matrix` has its own `AgentAdapter` family for autonomous skill activation.
- `judge` has native Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Vibe backends plus an untyped shell `--judge-cmd` escape hatch for every other provider.
- Tool replay exists through `run-subagent`, not through every native CLI runner.

Those implementation families remain intentionally separate, but their registration is now unified. `agent_capabilities.BACKENDS` is the declarative owner of answer route and executable answer entrypoints, native answer/trigger/judge bindings, workspace-builder, lazy trace-dialect implementation, capability, smoke, failure-marker, and provider CLI-option bindings. `AGENT_BACKENDS`, `JUDGE_BACKENDS`, `run_trigger_matrix.ADAPTERS`, `TRACE_DIALECTS`, `WORKSPACE_BUILDERS`, `AGENT_CAPABILITIES`, and `SMOKE_TARGETS` are derived compatibility views. Existing entries in the mutable implementation dispatch maps can still be replaced temporarily by tests and integrations; policy projections are deeply immutable. Adding a backend requires one complete registry row rather than adding unrelated keys piecemeal.

`skill-benchmark agent-capabilities` lists every row, explicit answer route (`native`, `export_import`, `subagent`, or `none`), executable command entrypoints, broader capability, and native command binding without invoking a provider. The distinction is intentional: Jetty answers through export/import and `subagent` through its dedicated runner, so neither has a native `run-agent` binding. Lazy object references keep the registry acyclic even while the answer/judge implementations remain in `skill_benchmark.py` and trigger implementations remain in `run_trigger_matrix.py`; registry serialization does not dereference handlers, while normal CLI import still materializes compatibility implementation views. Direct-script entrypoints alias their `__main__` module to the canonical import name before resolving those references, preventing a second module instance with divergent classes and mutable views.

Each row's lower-case stable backend name becomes its trace source/dialect key, and the runtime trace map resolves that row's lazy implementation instead of repeating backend keys in a second registry. Validation has two gates:

1. **Construction** rejects incomplete capability/binding combinations, non-lazy implementation/workspace references, mutable nested declarations, out-of-vocabulary capability/telemetry scalars, non-boolean booleans, conflicting CLI flags, and invalid route ownership before a command can make a provider call. Command names must agree with their handler names and phase prefixes; native routes bind `run-agent`, subagent routes bind only `run-subagent`, and export/import routes declare exactly one typed export, run, and import phase whose command is owned by that backend's stable name.
2. **Materialization** resolves the lazy references and rejects the wrong runtime shape before publishing a compatibility map: answer implementations identify with the row and implement `invoke_answer`; trigger adapters identify with the row and implement `mount`, `invoke`, and `detect`; judge implementations and workspace builders are callable; trace objects implement the full trace-semantics contract.

This split is deliberate. Type annotations and a frozen outer dataclass do not validate runtime inputs or make captured lists immutable, while a syntactically valid lazy reference says nothing about the object it will resolve to.

## Goals

1. Inventory the features currently built for Claude.
2. State the Codex parity gap and how the newer Codex CLI flags reduce it.
3. Record the first-class Gemini CLI and Mistral Vibe implementations and their honest capability gaps.
4. Define a shared adapter interface that can support arbitrary agents across answer runs, trigger measurement, judging, trace normalization, cost telemetry, and tool replay.
5. Keep the existing run-output contract stable: `output.md`, `metadata.json`, `events.json`, `metrics.json`, optional turn directories, and benchmark/judge result JSONL formats.

## Non-goals

- Do not move grading itself behind a model. Deterministic grading and aggregation remain model-free.
- Do not treat forced-load answer runs as autonomous trigger evidence.
- Do not require every agent to support every surface. Adapters declare capabilities; commands fail fast or degrade explicitly when a surface is unsupported.
- Do not trust one judge model by default. The existing `compare-judges`, `judge-alignment`, and `judge-robustness` gates remain necessary.

## Quality refactorings required by this plan

The point of the adapter work is not only feature parity. The refactor should make every implementation easier to test, less brittle, and more comparable. The implementation plan must therefore include these quality moves:

1. **Move provider-specific process code behind typed protocols.** Claude, Codex, Gemini, Vibe, Pi, Jetty, and future agents should return the same `InvocationResult` shape instead of leaking raw CLI dictionaries into grading, judging, or trigger code.
2. **Centralize subprocess execution semantics.** One runner utility should own timeout handling, cwd/env isolation, stdout/stderr capture, elapsed time, redaction, and nonzero-return recording. Adapter code should describe argv/env, not reinvent failure behavior.
3. **Separate workspace construction from invocation.** Skill mounting, input-file copying, ablation materialization, config-home isolation, and global-skill suppression should be independently testable without calling a model.
4. **Use golden parser fixtures per backend.** Each adapter needs checked-in raw stdout/stderr examples for success, schema failure, timeout/nonzero, tool-call traces, token usage, and cost/usage absence. Parser tests should not require live API credentials.
5. **Keep deterministic CI with fake adapters.** Every command path should be runnable against stub/fake backends that emit fixture traces and verdicts, so test coverage does not depend on Claude/Codex/Gemini/Vibe availability.
6. **Capability-gate command routing.** Commands must fail fast with actionable messages when an adapter does not support a requested surface (`native judge`, `trigger ablation`, `tool replay`, `schema-constrained output`) instead of silently degrading.
7. **Normalize telemetry in one place.** Token usage, dollar cost, model name, provider name, finish reason, and trace-derived metrics should flow through shared normalizers with explicit source labels (`provider_reported`, `trace_normalized`, `price_table_estimated`, `missing`).
8. **Preserve one failure taxonomy.** Timeout, max-turn/exceeded-budget, auth/config failure, schema-invalid judge verdict, missing final answer, and model refusal should map to stable metadata fields consumed consistently by `execution_valid`, reports, cost ledgers, and error analysis.
9. **Make security/isolation observable.** Run metadata should record config isolation mode, mounted skill roots, allowed tool policy, and whether global/user skills or context files were suppressed. Tests should assert these for each native adapter.
10. **Keep compatibility wrappers thin.** Existing `run-claude`, `run-codex`, and `judge --judge-model/--judge-cmd` should become wrappers around the shared registry so behavior stays stable while new adapters get the same core path.
11. **Enforce docs/registry drift tests.** `agent_capabilities.py`, `docs/agent-parity.md`, command help, and this spec should be checked together whenever a backend gains or loses a surface.
12. **Prefer conformance tests over provider-specific assertions.** The same tests should run against every adapter that claims a capability: final-answer extraction, trace normalization, judge verdict parsing, transcript writing, trigger detection, ablation provenance, and failure semantics.

## Current Claude features

| Surface | Current Claude behavior |
|---|---|
| Answer runs | `skill-benchmark run-claude` runs prepared rows through `claude -p --output-format json --no-session-persistence`. |
| Workspace isolation | Each row runs in a temp workspace with only prepared skill/input files mounted. |
| Variants | Supports `with_skill`, `without_skill`, `old_skill`, and materialized `ablation:<id>` via prepared rows. |
| Output contract | Writes `output.md`, `metadata.json`, normalized `events.json`/`metrics.json` where available. |
| Cost/usage | Parses Claude CLI envelope for real token usage and `total_cost_usd`; normalized into the existing telemetry blocks. |
| Failure semantics | Nonzero/timeout produces a failure body and metadata that `execution_valid` excludes from quality scoring while cost still counts. |
| Native judge | `skill-benchmark judge --judge-model <claude-model>` invokes Claude directly and captures judge cost/usage. |
| Judge transcripts | `--transcripts` records exact prompt, stdout, stderr, and parsed result per judge task. |
| Judge schema | Passes the canonical verdict schema to Claude via `--json-schema`; harness validation always fails malformed verdicts closed. The accepted `--strict-judge-schema` flag is a deprecated compatibility no-op. |
| Judge repeats | `--judge-runs` majority-votes pass/fail and medians scores. |
| Judge panels | `--judge-panel` aggregates multiple Claude models into consensus verdicts with agreement metadata. |
| Judge trajectory | `--judge-trajectory` passes normalized trajectory, metrics, and artifact inventory. |
| Tool-using judge | `--judge-explore` gives the native Claude judge a sanitized run copy with read-only tools; non-explore native Claude judges pass `--tools ""`. |
| Robustness | `judge-robustness` uses the same Claude native backend for order-flip and negative controls. |
| Autonomous trigger | `skill-trigger-matrix --agent claude` launches headless Claude Code subagents. |
| Trigger mounting | Project skills mounted under `.claude/skills`. |
| Trigger detection | Primary evidence is Claude's `Skill` tool invocation; fallback is shared path evidence. |
| Trigger ablations | Materialized trigger-population ablations are mounted and measured. |
| Tool replay | Available through `run-subagent`'s default Claude backend, not the `run-claude` CLI path. |

## Codex today and parity gap

| Surface | Codex today | Needed for Claude parity |
|---|---|---|
| Answer runs | `run-codex` / `run-agent --agent codex` use `codex exec --json --output-last-message <file>`: final answer from the sidecar file, JSONL retained as trace. | Keep; expand parser fixtures as event names evolve. |
| Workspace isolation | Temp workspace via prepared rows plus isolated `CODEX_HOME` outside the model workdir, seeded only with portable auth/config. | Keep; add adapter conformance tests shared with Claude. |
| Variants | Prepared-row variants and materialized ablations work. | Keep. |
| Trace artifacts | Codex JSONL normalized. | Expand parser fixtures for current event names and usage/cost events. |
| Token usage | Supported when stream reports it. | Make coverage explicit in `AgentCapabilities`. |
| Dollar cost | Currently `missing` unless a wrapper reports it. | Parse provider-reported cost if Codex exposes it, otherwise estimate from pricing table and mark source `price_table_estimated`. |
| Native judge | Implemented via `judge --judge-backend codex`. | Keep conformance coverage and add more parser fixtures as Codex event shapes evolve. |
| Judge schema | Implemented via `codex exec --output-schema <schema.json>` with a provider-compatible strict copy of the canonical verdict schema. | Keep harness-side schema validation as a fail-closed backstop. |
| Judge transcripts | Native transcripts stamp backend/model plus parsed usage/cost when present. | Expand cost coverage if Codex emits price/cost events. |
| Judge trajectory/explore | Generic `--judge-cmd` can receive prompt text only; no native sanitized tool access. | Add read-only workspace policy if Codex can inspect a sanitized run dir safely. |
| Autonomous trigger | `skill-trigger-matrix --agent codex` mounts `$CODEX_HOME/skills` in an external scratch home, exposes only that skills directory as an extra read root, and runs `codex exec --json` with isolated `CODEX_HOME`. | Add model matrix defaults if Codex exposes stable aliases. |
| Tool replay | None for native Codex CLI. | Implement through MCP/tool-host boundary or keep unsupported in native path and offer `run-subagent`/MCP replay. |

### Codex CLI reference impact

The Codex CLI reference materially lowers the native-judge implementation cost:

- `codex exec --output-last-message <file>` writes the final assistant response to a file, so a judge backend does not need to extract the verdict from event JSONL.
- `codex exec --output-schema <schema.json>` lets the harness pass the canonical per-assertion verdict schema to Codex.
- `codex exec --json` remains useful for trace/usage telemetry, but should not be treated as the verdict stream.
- `codex exec --model <model>`, `--skip-git-repo-check`, `--ephemeral`, `--sandbox`, `--ignore-user-config`, `--ignore-rules`, `--cd`, and isolated `CODEX_HOME` provide the controls needed for isolated eval execution.

A minimal native Codex judge can be:

1. Render the existing judge prompt.
2. Write `verdict_schema_for(assertion)` to a temp schema file.
3. Run `CODEX_HOME=$TMP/codex-home codex exec --model <model> --skip-git-repo-check --ephemeral --ignore-user-config --ignore-rules --sandbox read-only --output-schema schema.json --output-last-message verdict.json -` with prompt on stdin.
4. Parse `verdict.json` with the existing `extract_json_object` / schema checks.
5. Optionally also run with `--json` or a sidecar trace capture if usage/cost is needed.

## Gemini CLI support plan

External facts from Gemini CLI docs/README:

- Non-interactive mode: `gemini -p "..."`.
- Output modes: `--output-format text|json|stream-json`.
- JSON output includes a final `response` and `stats`; stream JSON includes events such as `init`, `message`, `tool_use`, `tool_result`, `error`, and `result` with aggregated statistics and per-model token usage.
- Model selection: `--model` / `-m`.
- Workspace controls include `--include-directories`, `--sandbox`, `--skip-trust`, extensions, policies, and MCP settings.
- Gemini CLI supports Agent Skills based on the open standard. Discovery tiers include extension skills, user skills under `~/.gemini/skills` or `~/.agents/skills`, and workspace skills under `.gemini/skills` or `.agents/skills`. Activation uses an `activate_skill` tool and asks for consent.
- `GEMINI.md` files provide persistent context, but they are not equivalent to on-demand skill activation.

### Gemini answer runner (implemented)

`GeminiBackend.invoke_answer` uses:

```bash
gemini -p "$PROMPT" \
  --model "$MODEL" \
  --output-format stream-json \
  --skip-trust \
  --policy "$ISOLATED_POLICY" \
  [--sandbox when auth transport is proven]
```

Implemented choices:

- Use prepared-row forced-load prompting for answer runs, just like Codex/Claude. The model sees workspace-relative skill paths and input files.
- Parse the official event union into frozen `GeminiStream` values. Final answer text comes only from assistant deltas after the last completed tool lifecycle and before one terminal successful `result`; the trace is never used as a text fallback.
- Normalize paired `tool_use`/`tool_result` into existing lifecycle events while validating Gemini protocol completeness separately from provider failure. Because `stream-json` omits `read_many_files`' processed-file list, its `include` globs never become file/skill-read evidence.
- Normalize `stats` and per-model token usage into `usage_normalized`; absent stats stay `missing`, and cost is `missing` because the CLI has no cost field.
- Use a fresh `GEMINI_CLI_HOME` outside the model workdir. A valid configured `security.auth.selectedType` wins; environment-selector precedence applies only when settings do not choose a type. Copy only credential material and supporting environment required by that one planned mode, force portable file storage when needed, disable interactive browser auth, and fail closed on invalid/nonportable plans. Explicit ADC is copied into the isolated home and rejected if its source is model-readable. The isolated user settings disable ordinary workspace/ancestor `.env` loading and request disabled provider usage statistics; early workspace trust stays unset so Gemini-specific ancestor env files are skipped before `--skip-trust` takes effect. Machine administrator settings may still override either user-tier request. Do not copy user skills, extensions, MCP configuration, hooks, context, policies, sessions, or history.
- Reject workspace `.gemini`, `.agents`, `.geminiignore`, and `GEMINI.md` provider controls case-insensitively before process invocation. Accept exactly one caller-trusted executable token, strip ambient Gemini/sandbox/debug/endpoint/telemetry controls while preserving auth routing, then load one harness policy that denies all tools and allows only `glob`, `grep_search`, `list_directory`, `read_file`, and `read_many_files`.
- Reject active `@path` references and leading slash commands before spawn because Gemini preprocesses them before the tool-policy and `stream-json` lifecycle. Bind prompt/model values with `--flag=value` so leading-dash data cannot be reinterpreted by the CLI parser.
- Request sandboxing only when a supported engine is detected and the relevant container credential transport is proven; macOS seatbelt runs in the host credential context. Portable legacy OAuth files and explicit ADC can cross a container boundary; GCA/encrypted OAuth, keychain-only API-key auth, implicit ADC, and unproven metadata auth cannot. Artifacts disclose the decision and retain the policy/config/workspace isolation that still applies. Machine-owned administrator-tier settings and policy can still override user-tier auth/tool choices.
- Probe and record the installed CLI version on every invocation. The live smoke requires version evidence; parser fixtures retain their pinned upstream commit and package snapshot.

### Gemini judge backend (implemented)

A native Gemini judge uses:

```bash
gemini -p "$JUDGE_PROMPT" --model "$MODEL" --output-format stream-json \
  --policy "$DENY_ALL_POLICY" --skip-trust \
  [--sandbox when auth transport is proven]
```

`GeminiStream` validates the complete event lifecycle and per-model token stats; only
the final assistant segment reaches the canonical verdict parser. The judge rejects
any observed tool lifecycle and treats a nonzero aggregate tool counter as a secondary
failure signal. Gemini does not expose an
external verdict-schema flag, so `verdict_schema_for` remains the fail-closed
gate. `JudgeInvocation` now has optional immutable `raw_response` and `metadata`
fields, allowing Gemini's original raw stream, session, resolved models, and
isolation disclosures to survive as transcript sidecars without making every
judge backend return provider-shaped dictionaries.
Gemini `--judge-explore` is rejected at both CLI and programmatic seams until a
separately tested read-only policy exists.

### Gemini autonomous trigger

Gemini is a strong candidate for real trigger measurement because it has native Agent Skills:

- Mount the materialized skill tree under workspace `.agents/skills/<skill-name>` or `.gemini/skills/<skill-name>`.
- Run the raw trigger query with no forced-load instruction.
- Prove a narrow policy rule can allow `activate_skill` noninteractively without enabling unrelated write/shell/network tools. Do not use an allow-all or YOLO mode as the proof.
- Detect activation from stream events: `activate_skill` tool call, skill path access, or Gemini-specific skill activation event if present.
- Keep path-evidence fallback, but label primary Gemini evidence separately from fallback file reads.

### Gemini risks/open questions

- Activation consent currently blocks the trigger capability claim; `autonomous_trigger=false` and no trigger binding is registered until a token-backed proof passes.
- User-tier policy cannot overrule administrator-tier policy. Invocation artifacts disclose this rather than claiming a stronger sandbox boundary than Gemini provides.
- `GEMINI.md` context is rejected, not used as a substitute for skill activation, because it is always loaded rather than on-demand.
- The official conformance snapshot can emit a completed tool event while its `tool_calls` telemetry counter is zero. Lifecycle validity and telemetry shape are therefore independent invariants.

## Mistral Vibe support plan

External facts from Mistral Vibe README:

- Noninteractive mode: `vibe --prompt "..."`; the harness passes prompt text as the option argument because headless stdin prompt mode is not reliable without a tty.
- Output modes: `--output text|json|streaming`.
- Cost/usage controls: `--max-price`, `--max-tokens`.
- Agent profiles: `default`, `plan`, `accept-edits`, `auto-approve`, custom agents; `--auto-approve` / `--yolo` for unattended runs.
- Tool controls: `--enabled-tools`, `enabled_tools`, `disabled_tools`.
- Configuration root can be isolated with `VIBE_HOME`.
- Skills follow the Agent Skills specification and are discovered from custom `skill_paths`, `.agents/skills/`, `.vibe/skills/`, `~/.vibe/skills/`, and `~/.agents/skills/`.
- API key: `MISTRAL_API_KEY` or `~/.vibe/.env`.

### Vibe answer runner

Implemented in `VibeBackend.invoke_answer`: the harness runs Vibe with a temp `VIBE_HOME` outside the model workdir and a project workspace:

```bash
VIBE_HOME="$TMP/vibe-home" VIBE_ACTIVE_MODEL="$MODEL" vibe \
  --prompt "$PROMPT" \
  --output streaming \
  --workdir "$WORKSPACE" \
  --trust \
  --auto-approve \
  --enabled-tools skill \
  --enabled-tools read_file \
  --enabled-tools grep
```

Adapter choices:

- For answer runs, use forced-load prepared-row prompting and copied skill/input files.
- Use `--output streaming` for trace normalization; JSON-list output is accepted by the parser for tests/fallbacks.
- Normalize Vibe messages/tool calls into existing event shapes.
- Current Vibe `json`/`streaming` output is `LLMMessage` data and does not export `AgentStats`, so usage/cost are explicit `missing` unless a future CLI adds fields or the harness estimates them.

### Vibe judge backend

Implemented with `vibe --prompt "$PROMPT" --output json --enabled-tools re:^$`. Since judge prompts already contain candidate output and rubric, the judge profile disables tools entirely. Vibe JSON output returns messages rather than just final text, so the adapter extracts the final assistant message and parses it as verdict JSON; harness-side schema validation remains the gate.

### Vibe autonomous trigger

Vibe trigger measurement is implemented because it natively discovers Agent Skills:

- Mount skills under workspace `.agents/skills/<skill-name>` for cross-agent standard compatibility.
- Isolate `VIBE_HOME` outside the model workdir to avoid global skills/config bleed and keep copied `.env` out of readable project paths.
- Use `--workdir` plus `--trust` so headless runs do not prompt.
- Run raw trigger queries with no forced-load instruction.
- Detect activation from native `skill` tool calls by skill name; fall back to path evidence from reading the mounted `SKILL.md`.

### Vibe risks/open questions

- Token-backed smoke should be rerun after Vibe CLI or provider changes; the harness has live-smoke tests gated by `RUN_AGENT_INVOKE_SMOKE=1` and `RUN_VIBE_TRIGGER_SMOKE=1`.
- Vibe 2.19.1 exposes `--auto-approve`, `--trust`, and tool allowlists; the adapter uses read-only tools for answer/trigger and no tools for judging.
- Model selection is handled with `VIBE_ACTIVE_MODEL`; current usage/cost telemetry is absent from CLI output and normalized as explicit `missing`.

## Shared adapter interface

The shared interface should split capability surfaces instead of making every backend implement a monolith. The block below is the **target shape**, not the exact implemented dataclasses: today's `InvocationRequest` has only `prompt`, `workspace`, `model`, and `timeout_s`, while environment and provider options remain adapter-owned; today's `InvocationResult` also carries explicit process-state and UTF-8-validity fields but has not eliminated every provider-local dictionary seam.

### Core types

```python
@dataclass(frozen=True)
class InvocationRequest:
    prompt: str
    workspace: Path
    model: str | None
    timeout_s: int
    allowed_tools: list[str] | None = None
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class InvocationResult:
    stdout: str
    stderr: str
    returncode: int
    elapsed_ms: int
    timed_out: bool = False
    final_text: str | None = None
    raw_trace: str | None = None
    usage: dict[str, Any] | None = None
    cost_usd: float | None = None
    model: str | None = None
    provider: str | None = None
    finish_reason: str | None = None
    adapter_metadata: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)

@dataclass(frozen=True)
class JudgeInvocation:
    stdout: str
    stderr: str
    returncode: int
    usage: Mapping[str, Any] | None = None
    cost_usd: float | None = None
    usage_source: Literal["provider_reported", "trace_normalized"] = "provider_reported"
    model_label: str | None = None
```

### Protocols

```python
class AgentBackend(Protocol):
    name: str
    default_models: list[str | None]
    capabilities: AgentCapabilities

    def mount_answer_workspace(self, task: PreparedTask, workspace: Path) -> WorkspaceMount: ...
    def invoke(self, request: InvocationRequest) -> InvocationResult: ...
    def parse_trace(self, result: InvocationResult) -> TraceBundle: ...
    def final_answer(self, result: InvocationResult) -> str: ...

class JudgeBackend(Protocol):
    # Verdict schema, tool policy, and exploration options belong here rather
    # than on answer-runner InvocationRequest.
    def judge(self, task: JudgeTask, model: str | None, options: JudgeOptions) -> JudgeInvocation: ...

class TriggerBackend(Protocol):
    def mount_trigger_skill(self, tree_dir: Path, workspace: Path) -> list[Path]: ...
    def invoke_trigger(self, query: str, model: str | None, workspace: Path, timeout_s: int) -> InvocationResult: ...
    def detect_skill_invocation(self, result: InvocationResult, skill_names: list[str], mounted_paths: list[Path]) -> TriggerEvidence: ...

class ToolReplayBackend(Protocol):
    def tool_host(self, workspace: Path, replay_store: ToolReplayStore) -> ToolHost | None: ...
```

### Capability flags

Extend `AgentCapabilities` beyond the current booleans:

- `answer_runner`: no / forced-load / native-skill-load.
- `autonomous_trigger`: no / path-evidence / native-skill-event.
- `trigger_ablation`: no / materialized-answer / materialized-discovery.
- `judge_backend`: no / shell-wrapper / native.
- `judge_schema`: none / prompt-only / cli-enforced / api-enforced.
- `trace_artifacts`: none / final-only / json / stream-json.
- `token_usage`: none / provider-reported / trace-derived.
- `dollar_cost`: provider-reported / trace-normalized / estimated / missing / not-applicable.
- `skill_mount`: forced-path / project-skill-dir / user-skill-dir / extension / mcp.
- `tool_replay`: none / mcp / hosted-tools / native-log-only.
- `config_isolation`: env-home / cli-flag / partial / none.

### Command routing

- `run-agent --agent claude|codex|gemini|vibe|...` should replace provider-specific answer runners long-term, while keeping `run-claude`/`run-codex` as compatibility aliases.
- `judge --judge-backend claude|codex|gemini|vibe|cmd` should replace the overloaded `--judge-model` / `--judge-cmd` split long-term.
- `skill-trigger-matrix` consumes the same registry and its `TriggerBackend` implementations through the derived `ADAPTERS` compatibility view.
- `agent-capabilities` is the JSON introspection command; the parity document remains the reviewed reader-facing rendering.

## Conformance tests for any adapter

Every new backend must pass offline or stubbed tests for:

1. Final-answer extraction.
2. Nonzero and timeout failure semantics.
3. Token/cost normalization when the backend claims support.
4. Trace event normalization for tool calls and final results.
5. Judge JSON parsing for binary, graded-dimension, and dynamic-rubric schemas.
6. Judge transcript writing.
7. Workspace isolation: no source repo, eval oracle, or unrelated global skills visible.
8. Trigger mounting and activation detection, if `autonomous_trigger` is claimed.
9. Materialized ablation provenance: same canonical tree hash as matching full-skill arm.
10. Unified registry/docs drift: `agent_capabilities.py`, `docs/agent-parity.md`, and tests must agree.
11. Direct `python skill_benchmark.py` and `python run_trigger_matrix.py` entrypoints resolve the same implementation objects as installed console scripts.
12. Registered answer/trigger implementations identify with the row's stable name, and provider CLI flags do not collide.
13. Every non-`none` answer route declares executable, route-specific command phases whose handler names agree with the CLI parser and registry dispatch.
14. Answer, trigger, judge, workspace, and trace references satisfy their runtime contracts before compatibility views are published.
15. Nested declarations are tuple-backed, capability booleans are exact booleans, and capability/telemetry scalar values use closed vocabularies.

Live smoke tests remain opt-in by env var, one per adapter:

- `RUN_TRIGGER_SMOKE` for Claude.
- `RUN_CODEX_TRIGGER_SMOKE` for Codex.
- `RUN_GEMINI_SMOKE` for Gemini's native answer path; add a distinct trigger smoke only when the activation gate passes.
- `RUN_VIBE_TRIGGER_SMOKE` for Mistral Vibe.
- `RUN_AGENT_INVOKE_SMOKE` for cheap auth/process checks across autonomous adapters.

## Phased implementation plan

1. **Refactor without behavior change** — implemented.
   - Extract Claude and Codex answer invocation into `AgentBackend` implementations.
   - Keep old commands as wrappers.
   - Register answer, trigger, and judge implementations in `agent_capabilities.BACKENDS`; keep implementation code separate and project the old dictionaries for compatibility.
2. **Codex native judge** — done for the current CLI surface.
   - Uses `--output-last-message` and `--output-schema`.
   - Parses optional JSONL telemetry when present.
   - Capability row now advertises native judge support.
3. **Shared judge backend CLI** — initial implementation done.
   - `--judge-backend claude|codex|gemini|vibe|cmd` selects the backend.
   - `--judge-cmd` remains `backend=cmd` for arbitrary providers.
4. **Gemini adapter** — answer runner and judge implemented with strict official wire contracts and isolated CLI state.
   - Trigger adapter remains gated on proven headless Agent Skills activation.
5. **Mistral Vibe adapter** — implemented with local/fake contracts and token-backed smoke evidence for Vibe 2.19.1.
   - Answer runner and judge use `--output json|streaming` and isolated `VIBE_HOME`.
   - Trigger adapter mounts `.agents/skills` and detects native `skill` tool calls with path fallback.
6. **Tool replay generalization**
   - Prefer MCP as the common tool-host boundary for agents that support it.
   - Keep native CLI runners replay-free unless their tool calls can be mediated through harness-owned tools.

## Acceptance criteria

- The harness can list every registered agent and its surfaces from one registry.
- Claude behavior remains byte-compatible at the run-output/report level.
- Codex supports native judging without a handwritten shell wrapper.
- Gemini has native answer and judge surfaces with an explicitly gated trigger claim; Vibe has native answer, judge, and trigger surfaces tied to its published CLI.
- A new agent can be added by implementing protocols plus conformance tests, without editing grading, benchmarking, ablation, or trigger core logic.
