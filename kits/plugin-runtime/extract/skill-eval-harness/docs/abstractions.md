# Key abstractions

The harness is a pipeline. Each stage hands one well-defined object to the next: a manifest
becomes task rows, task rows become files on disk, files on disk become graded result rows,
and result rows become a report. Because the boundaries are explicit, you can swap the
runner without touching grading, and the default grading path never has to call a model.

This is the **engineering lens** on the terms in [`vocabulary.md`](vocabulary.md): what each object *is* in the code and what it hands downstream. The glossary defines the words; this page shows their shape. Symbols below point at `skill_benchmark.py` at the line where each abstraction is defined.

## The objects, in pipeline order

| Abstraction | Defined by | What it hands downstream |
|---|---|---|
| CLI invocation | `cli_contracts.ValidatedLegacyCLIInvocation` | One validated command, typed projections, and the explicit legacy-handler adapter. |
| Manifest | `validate_manifest` | The full test definition for one skill. |
| Case | `iter_cases` | One scenario with a prompt and graders. |
| Variant | `manifest_contracts.ExecutionVariant` / `task_variants` | The arm a case runs under; the lift axis. |
| Split | `manifest_contracts.Split` | Which cases are visible during iteration. |
| Assertion | `assertion_result` | A single pass/fail check over one run. |
| Prepared task row | `prepared_task_rows` | A runner-neutral unit of work. |
| Run-output contract | `discover_run_bases` | The files a runner leaves on disk. |
| Runner / adapter | `run_codex` | Turns a task row into contract files. |
| Trace normalization | `normalize_trace_records` | Runner-specific events, made uniform. |
| Judge plumbing | `collect_judge_tasks` | Qualitative checks, deferred to a model you supply. |
| Grade result row | `grade_case_variant` | One scored row per case/variant/run. |
| Benchmark report | `build_benchmark_report` | Aggregates, lift, and flags. |

## CLI invocation

`argparse` owns syntax and help text, but its namespace is untrusted wire data. Immediately after
parsing, `CLIInvocation.from_namespace` validates the closed `CLICommand` vocabulary, converts path
arguments to `Path`, parses split, execution-variant, and model identities, and rejects non-finite
or command-invalid numeric limits. Its raw argument bag is recursively frozen. Established handlers
do not yet consume the typed projections: they cross the single named `to_legacy_namespace`
adapter, while new or migrated handlers can accept the typed value. This is migration scaffolding,
not a claim that `ty` already checks every handler's options.

The parser choices and `CLICommand` must be the same set. At dispatch, built-in handlers and
backend-projected answer entrypoints must form a disjoint, complete partition of that set. Adding a
command therefore requires an explicit parser spelling, enum member, handler owner, documentation,
and tests; an unknown or multiply owned command cannot fall through a string-based `if` chain.

## Manifest

`evals/shared-benchmark.json` is the source of truth. It names the skill, the files under
test (`skill_paths`), the comparison arms (`variants`), the split policy, the `cases`, and
the `ablations`. `validate_manifest` rejects a manifest whose fixtures are missing, whose
regex assertions do not compile, or whose hidden cases lack a private prompt reference.
Optional blocks (`harness`, `jetty`, `run_protocol`) carry interop and runner hints without
changing the core shape.

## Case

A case is one scenario: an `id`, a `split`, a descriptive `kind` (for example `behavior`,
`negative`, `adversarial`, or `trigger`), the `prompt` or a private `prompt_ref`, optional fixture `files`, `expected_behavior` notes, the
`assertions`, and a taxonomy the report slices on (`domain`, `difficulty`, `trigger_type`,
`success_goals`). `iter_cases` filters by the explicitly requested split. The CLI keeps split
outputs distinct; authors/CI still control when hidden splits are run and whether prompts live in
private `prompt_ref` files.

## Variant

A variant is the arm a case runs under: `with_skill`, `without_skill`, an optional pinned
`old_skill`, or `ablation:<id>`. Variants are orthogonal to cases, which is the whole point
of the tool. Lift is the difference between `with_skill` and `without_skill` on the same
case, so the variant axis is where skill effect becomes measurable. `variant_instruction`
writes the per-arm instruction; the baseline must run from a workspace that cannot read the
skill files, or the comparison means nothing.

In process, every arm is an `ExecutionVariant`: a validated `str` subtype that closes the base
vocabulary and owns the `ablation:<id>` encoding. It retains the existing JSON/path spelling, so
the type strengthens the boundary without changing persisted artifacts. `task_variants` returns
these typed values instead of unchecked strings.

## Split

`tune`, `holdout`, and `holdback` label the intended evaluation phase. Tune cases are for
iteration; holdout is intended for end-of-round scoring; holdback is intended to remain outside the
skill/docs/eval descriptions until after scoring. The harness filters and reports these labels but
does not provide access control—repositories and CI must keep private material private. `prepare` refuses to emit a hidden case with no
`prompt_ref` unless you pass `--allow-missing-prompts` for dry-run planning.

`Split` is the corresponding closed `str` subtype. `CaseKind` remains intentionally extensible
for descriptive labels, but it owns the only structural classification the runners need:
`answer` versus `trigger`. `PreparedTask.from_row` parses all three identity values at the wire
boundary, and the executable task carries their precise types thereafter.

## Assertion

An assertion is one check. The code-side registries are `TEXT_ASSERTIONS`,
`PROCESS_ASSERTIONS`, `EFFICIENCY_ASSERTIONS`, and `QUALITATIVE_ASSERTIONS`
(`skill_benchmark.py:66-95`):

- **Text** (`contains`, `contains_any`, `contains_all`, `excludes_any`, `regex`,
  `not_regex`, `file_exists`, `json_field_equals`, `golden_output`, `similarity`,
  `structured_output`, `script`): runs against `output.md` and sibling files.
- **Process** (`skill_invoked`, `command_ran`, `command_not_ran`, `command_order`,
  `tool_call`, `tool_count_le`, `no_repeated_command_loop`): runs against normalized trace
  events, and fails closed when the evidence is absent.
- **Efficiency** (`total_tokens_le`, `elapsed_seconds_le`, `command_count_le`): runs against
  metrics.
- **Qualitative** (`judge`, `rubric`, and the `factuality` preset): deferred to a model you
  supply.

`assertion_result` returns `{name, type, passed, evidence, score}`. Every result carries a
`score` (binary detectors mirror `passed` as `1.0`/`0.0`; `similarity`, `golden_output`, and a
graded `script` oracle set a real value), and `grade_case_variant` stamps a `severity`
(`critical`/`gate`/`soft`) and an `oracle` tier (`strong`/`demo`/`live`) on each.

Severity decides how a result counts: a `critical` failure vetoes the run and is excluded from
every mean; a `gate` carries the pass rate; a `soft` result feeds only the graded score. The
graded shape (roadmap 2.2, ported from `adewale/anti-slop-writing`) adds two `judge` assertion
forms:

```jsonc
// anchored dimension: the judge scores against named, observable anchors
{ "type": "judge", "graded_dimensions": [
  { "name": "specificity", "scale": "1-5",
    "rubric": "5 = names the failure mode and the mechanism; 1 = generic restatement" }
] }

// dynamic rubric: the judge drafts case-specific criteria, then grades against them
{ "type": "judge", "dynamic_rubric": { "instruction": "draft 3-5 criteria from the brief",
                                       "minimum_criteria": 3 } }
```

A graded assertion answers "how much better," where the binary `passed` answers only "right or
wrong." That distinction is the reason a saturated binary case can still show graded lift. An
optional `reference_score`/`reference_graded_score` on a case sets a no-regression floor, and
`build_paired_summary` reports a paired `graded` channel and a sign-flip significance test
beside the raw lift.

## Prepared task row

`prepared_task_rows` fans `cases × variants × models × runs_per_variant` into runner-neutral
rows (the `model` axis, from `prepare --models`, adds a run-dir segment only when two or more
models run, so single-model layouts are unchanged). Each row carries the `prompt`, the absolute
`input_files`, the `skill_paths`, the `instruction` for its arm, and the `run_dir` it must
write to. Generation rows omit `expected_behavior` and rubrics unless you pass
`--include-answer-key`, so a runner cannot accidentally feed the answer key to the model under
test.

There are two in-process types. `PreparedTaskDraft` may hold partial planning data but is never
executable. `PreparedTaskDraft.validate()` / `PreparedTask.from_row()` constructs a strict
`PreparedTask`: identifiers and paths are validated, split and execution variant are closed,
repetition is positive, `run_dir` is safe and relative, and `without_skill` cannot carry skill
paths. Every native runner and Jetty exporter requires the executable type.

`CaseId`, `ModelId`, and `RunNumber` keep the run identity dimensions distinct from ordinary
strings and integers. They serialize as the existing scalar values, while construction rejects an
empty case/model or a boolean, zero, or negative repetition before that identity reaches pairing.

The prepared rows also form a persisted `answer-design.json`: the exact expected
case/model/repetition identities plus a digest of manifest inputs, referenced oracles, and
variant instructions. Each produced run repeats the design, task, and instruction digests.
Report builders re-derive the current eval contract and require exact design coverage before
publishing paired or aggregate headlines; surviving rows from an incomplete design are retained
only as explicitly observed diagnostics.

## Run-output contract

The contract is the file boundary between any runner and the harness:

```
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/[run-<n>/]output.md
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/[run-<n>/]metadata.json     # optional
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/[run-<n>/]trace.jsonl        # optional, raw
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/[run-<n>/]events.json        # optional, normalized
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/[run-<n>/]metrics.json       # optional, normalized
runs/<case_id>/<variant>/[run-<n>/]artifact-commit.json # harness-written commit marker
```

`discover_run_bases` and `read_output_base` read this layout. A runner that writes these
files is a valid runner, whether it is Pi, Codex, Jetty, a subagent, or a person with a text
editor. Harness-owned schema-v1 writers commit their required files and SHA-256 inventory by
writing `artifact-commit.json` last; a missing or stale marker makes such a declared artifact
set incomplete. Legacy or externally written runs that do not declare that contract version
remain readable through the compatibility boundary. This boundary is the main extension seam
in the codebase.

`artifact_contracts.observe_artifact_set` reads that seam into exactly one frozen value:
`LegacyArtifactSet | MissingArtifactCommit | InvalidArtifactCommit | IncompleteArtifactSet |
CompleteArtifactSet`. A malformed marker and a valid marker whose files were interrupted or
tampered with are therefore different states. Existing dictionary readers retain
`artifact_set_complete` as a compatibility projection and expose the reasoned state alongside it.
Likewise, `read_event_log_base` produces `MissingEventLog | InvalidEventLog | LoadedEventLog`;
`read_events_base` is only the legacy tuple adapter. Strict JSON parsing lives in
`json_contracts.py`, so every disk reader shares duplicate-key and non-finite-number rejection.

## Runner / adapter

An **answer runner** consumes prepared task rows and produces the run-output contract. The repo
ships Pi answer smoke (`examples/adewale-workspace/run_pi_smoke.py`), Codex (`run_codex:10472`), Claude (`run_claude:10658`, capturing real
per-run cost), Gemini CLI and Mistral Vibe (`run-agent --agent gemini|vibe`, using isolated provider homes outside the workdir), the in-process
subagent runner (`run_subagent:13248`, which hosts record/replay tool I/O via `ToolReplayStore`),
Jetty (`JettyClient:4028` and the export/run/import commands), and any runner that writes the
contract directly. Each answer runner registers a workspace builder so one cross-runner invariant
proves its `without_skill` arm is skill-free (CF.2). Autonomous trigger runners are separate: they
read trigger cases from the manifest directly, never consume answer task rows, and emit trigger
observations plus optional traces rather than answer grades.

Native answer backends return the frozen `Completed | TimedOut | SpawnFailed | ProviderFailed`
union from `runner_contracts.py`. `OutcomeContext` validates provider, telemetry, and elapsed-time
fields; `write_runner_outcome` exhaustively writes the disk contract. A backend therefore cannot
independently set timeout, return code, answer, and failure into a contradictory bag. The harness
calls no model during default grading; it reads what the runner left behind. The explicit
`--allow-scripts` and `--embed-cmd` modes may invoke caller-supplied external oracle subprocesses.

Before a native provider subprocess starts, `invocation_contracts.py` constructs one
`ProcessInvocationPlan`: immutable argv, stdin, working directory, environment, and a positive
`TimeoutSeconds`. `run_argv_capture` accepts only that plan and returns the closed
`InvocationResult` lifecycle. The answer backend receives the smaller `InvocationRequest`, whose
model and timeout are also precise values. Provider adapters can choose wire formats, but they
cannot omit or disagree about process inputs after the plan boundary. The same module owns the
shared `InvocationState` vocabulary: `InvocationResult` admits only process-boundary states, while
provider or harness failures remain semantic classifications and never rewrite the observed return
code.

## Trace normalization

Runners disagree on event shape. Codex emits `command_execution` and `turn.completed`; Pi
emits `message_end` usage aliases; Jetty emits trajectory records. `normalize_trace_record`
and `normalize_trace_records` collapse these into one schema-versioned `events.json` plus
`metrics.json`, tagged with the source. Loading `events.json` first constructs the closed event-log
observation above. `trace_contracts.EventState` then classifies each event as
completed, in-progress, failed, or unknown; only completed operations contribute command/tool/file
counts. Process and efficiency assertions read the normalized form, never the raw prose, because
inferring tool use from answer text is how false evidence gets in.

Autonomous trigger execution crosses the parallel `trigger_contracts.py` boundary: process state,
completion evidence, detection evidence, and the final observation are closed values before
`trigger_reporting.py` constructs a complete, incomplete, or empty cohort.

## Judge plumbing

Qualitative assertions defer. `collect_judge_tasks` gathers every `judge`/`rubric` assertion
across runs and keys each by `judge_task_id` (`case::variant::run-n::assertion`, with a `model`
segment on a multi-model run). `grade --judge-tasks` can serialize that queue, while the
`judge` command reconstructs the same tasks from the manifest and run directory rather than
reading the optional queue file. Before queuing, `grading_contracts.JudgeTask` validates and freezes
the case/model/variant/run identity, paths, assertion, conversation, and prompt/evidence
fingerprints. `judge_prompt` renders the case, expected behavior, rubric,
and candidate output into a prompt — including the anchored dimensions or dynamic-rubric
instruction for a graded assertion; `run_one_judge_task` pipes it to the `--judge-cmd` you
supply or to a native `--judge-backend` (`claude`, `codex`, `gemini`, or `vibe`) plus
`--judge-model`;
both routes construct the frozen `judge_contracts.JudgeInvocation` boundary before any verdict
parsing. It closes return code, output, immutable usage/cost telemetry, provenance, and model
identity, so a newly registered backend cannot feed a dictionary-shaped partial contract into row
assembly. `merge_repeated_judge_rows` majority-votes pass/fail and medians scores across repeats. The
harness picks no model. At the result boundary, `judge_verdict.py` parses one strict variant:
boolean, scored, dimension-scored, dynamic-rubric, or consensus. Pass is derived from the typed
payload; duplicate IDs and contradictory score/threshold/pass rows are rejected. The serialized
row still carries `{judge_task_id, verdict_kind, passed, score, evidence}` — plus
`dimension_scores`/`criteria` for a graded verdict and normalized `usage_normalized`/
`cost_normalized` for judge spend — merged back whenever `grade` or `benchmark` receives
`--judge-results`. Both task and result carry `judge_input_sha256`, binding the verdict to the
exact rendered prompt, candidate output, and evidence. A stale or mismatched result is rejected
or re-queued even when its `judge_task_id` still matches.

## Grade result row

`grade_case_variant` produces one row per case/variant/run. It separates objective, process,
efficiency, and qualitative counts, computes each pass rate, marks `missing_output` when a run
never produced text, and carries the run `metadata`. Deferred judge assertions leave a task
behind rather than a verdict. Grading reads from disk and calls no model, which is what makes
a default re-grade cheap and deterministic; opt-in script and embedding oracles are the explicit
external-process exceptions.

Before aggregation, every objective and qualitative row becomes one
`SatisfiedAssertion | FailedAssertion | UnavailableAssertion | SkippedAssertion`. Severity and
oracle tier are closed enums, scores must be finite, and unavailable/skipped rows cannot enter a
pass-rate denominator. The legacy dictionary rows are serialized only after typed aggregation, so
`passed: null`, dependency skips, and observed failures no longer share an implicit falsy branch.

## Benchmark report

`build_benchmark_report` invokes the shared grader for each discovered run, then
turns those in-memory result rows into the artifact you read. It does not consume the output
of the `grade` command. Before arithmetic,
`experimental_pairs.py` constructs exact `(case, model, repetition, population)` identities and
requires one eligible treatment and control arm from an explicit `ContrastSpec`. The default
skill-presence contrast maps to the existing `with_skill`/`without_skill` wire rows.
The stable identity of a comparison result is `(contrast_id, pair_key)`. Blocked rows and pairing
diagnostics serialize that contrast ID, so two different comparisons over the same execution rows
cannot collide or lose their causal question at a persistence boundary.
`build_paired_summary` computes per-case lift
(`with_skill` minus `without_skill`, normalized gain, and a flag when the skill hurts) only from
those pairs; missing/ineligible arms remain in `pairing` diagnostics and duplicate arms fail.
`build_slice_summary` breaks results down
by domain, difficulty, trigger type, and success goal. Case flags mark saturated, no-lift,
flaky, and with-skill-failed cases. These flags, the leakage lint
(`prompt_assertion_leakage_findings:813`), and the split discipline are the part of the tool
no surveyed eval framework copies.

`report_contracts.report_cohort` classifies each attempted reporting population as
`EmptyReportCohort | CompleteReportCohort | PartialReportCohort |
NotApplicableReportCohort` from one stable-identity attempt sequence before computing variant and
slice headlines. `metric_cohort` then refines that same population per rate: row completeness can
never authorize a survivor-only metric mean. Partial cohorts expose observed diagnostics but
withhold headline means; empty and non-applicable populations remain distinct. `UnitRate` rejects
booleans, non-finite numbers, and values
outside `[0, 1]` before `statistics` can aggregate them. Attempted, observed, and blocked counts are
derived from the same deeply frozen attempt dispositions, preventing consumers from assembling
inconsistent coverage or relying on Python object identity.

The pairing key carries `CaseId`, `ModelId | None`, `RunNumber`, and the closed
`ExperimentalPopulation` enum. The pair also carries a contrast whose canonical factor coordinates
separate activation, skill set, and content revision; those differing treatment coordinates do not
pollute the shared repetition identity. `ExperimentalPair` is generic in its payload, so pairing run paths
retains `Path` while pairing result rows retains their mapping interface; the shared constructor no
longer erases every downstream payload to `Any`.

When introducing or extending an abstraction, review the whole semantic path rather than only its
constructor:

1. name the untrusted boundary and the one owner that validates it;
2. define stable value identity independently of Python object identity and treatment differences;
3. keep process, provider, trace, judge, artifact, coverage, and telemetry facts on separate axes;
4. make every refinement monotone, especially per-metric report coverage;
5. serialize only at the artifact/UI edge, then re-validate on read; and
6. prove the model twice: malformed/contradictory runtime cases plus `ty` narrowing and exhaustive
   consumption.

The compact owner inventory and extension rules are in [`typed-python.md`](typed-python.md). The
failure models and adversarial proof styles are in
[`correctness-by-construction-audit.md`](correctness-by-construction-audit.md).

## What changes when you extend the tool

Two abstractions absorbed most of the roadmap, and they remain the seams to reach for next.
The numeric `score` and the `severity` tier live in the **assertion result shape**
(`assertion_result`) and the totals in `grade_case_variant`; the `model` sweep is a third axis
in the fan-out (`prepared_task_rows`) with a grouping in `build_benchmark_report`
(`by_model`/`model_analysis`). Both are cross-cutting: a change to either touches every place
that *aggregates* a run (each pass-rate/report view) or *identifies* one (`run_dir`, run
discovery, `judge_task_id`), so extend by auditing those consumers, not just the definition
site. Touch these carefully and most other features fall into place around them.
