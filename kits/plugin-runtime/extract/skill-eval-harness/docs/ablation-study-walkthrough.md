# Ablation study walkthrough (pinned, real skills)

A worked ablation study across ten real skills, captured so a future reader can
**reproduce it against the exact skill versions that were evaluated** — without this
repo vendoring any skill content. The skills live in their own repositories; here we
store only pointers (`repo` + commit `sha`) and the harness's canonical skill-tree
hash, in [`examples/skill-pins.json`](../examples/skill-pins.json).

> Want to run the harness first with **no external skills and no model**? Start with
> [`examples/demo-skill/`](../examples/demo-skill/) — it runs the whole loop offline.

## What was evaluated

Each skill at a pinned commit (all on `main`). `tree_hash` is
`skill_benchmark.canonical_skill_tree_hash(repo_root, manifest)` — recompute it after
fetching to prove you have the byte-identical tree that was scored here.

| skill | repo @ commit | tree_hash | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| anti-slop-writing | adewale/anti-slop-writing @ `891f6ff` | `a706f93b…` | |
| audit-skill | adewale/audit-skill @ `49cb1bb` | `437779bb…` | |
| cfdoctor | adewale/cfdoctor @ `39b1db6` | `d285b437…` | |
| good-pr | adewale/good-pr @ `06a2b99` | `e6db327c…` | |
| good-readme | adewale/good-readme @ `837e0d2` | `fc3b0830…` | |
| good-repo | adewale/good-repo @ `0aacc79` | `46727ded…` | |
| guardrails-skill | adewale/guardrails-skill @ `7eeeba9` | `193c293e…` | |
| slide-maker | adewale/slide-maker @ `b144fb7` | `1743f508…` | pinned to the tested commit; `main` advanced after the run |
| swiss-poster-skill | adewale/swiss-poster-skill @ `5ec0cb1` | `ea1b4952…` | |
| testing-best-practices | adewale/testing-best-practices @ `b883b57` | `d6339ae9…` | |

The slide-maker row is the point of pinning: by the time this was written, its `main`
HEAD had moved past the evaluated tree. The harness tree-hash caught the divergence,
so the pin points at the commit whose tree actually matches what ran — not a moving
branch.

## Method (and its limits)

- Runner: `claude -p` (headless) via `run-codex --codex-cmd`. cfdoctor + guardrails
  were scored on deterministic safety assertions; the other eight by an LLM judge
  (`claude -p` on the case rubric) on one behavioral case each.
  - This study predates the native Claude adapter. Today, use `run-claude --model …`
    (which captures real per-run cost into `metrics.json`) instead of the
    `run-codex --codex-cmd "claude -p"` workaround, and `compare-judges` to check whether
    the noisy judge verdicts below are judge-sensitive across two judge models.
- Arms per skill: `with_skill`, `without_skill`, and one **materialized** component
  ablation (the largest/most-central component).
- **This is a spot check.** Single behavioral case (or 3 safety cases) per skill,
  judge verdicts are noisy. Under the harness's own gates almost all of it is
  INDETERMINATE (measured, but unreplicated single shots cannot clear the
  significance gate), not CONFIRMED_CAUSAL. The three strongest signals were re-run
  **5× per arm** to separate signal from noise — and that mattered (below).

## Results

Spot check (✅ = pass / ❌ = fail; safety skills show pass rate over 3 cases):

| skill | with | without | component ablation | first read |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|
| testing-best-practices | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ `no-antipatterns` | skill helps + component load-bearing? |
| good-repo | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ `no-popularity-caveats` | skill helps; component not needed here |
| audit-skill | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ `no-severity-verdict` | skill helps; component not needed here |
| good-readme | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ `no-rubric` | "half-a-skill worse than none"? |
| anti-slop-writing | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ `no-flow-conclusion` | skill *hurts*? |
| good-pr | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | saturated (base model handles it) |
| slide-maker | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | saturated |
| swiss-poster | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | saturated |
| guardrails | 1.0 | 1.0 | 1.0 | saturated (base alignment already gates) |
| cfdoctor | .67 | .67 | 1.0 | no signal; keyword-brittle assertion |

Re-running the three "interesting" rows **5× per arm** overturned two of them:

| skill (case) | with | without | ablation | first read | holds at n=5? |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|:--:|
| anti-slop (earned-antithesis) | **0.2** | **1.0** | 0.2 | skill hurts | ⚠ direction replicated; paired gate underpowered |
| good-readme (agent-skill audit) | 0.4 | 0.2 | **0.8** | half-skill worse | ❌ refuted (noise) |
| testing (cli-doc-sync) | 1.0 | 0.6 | **1.0** | component load-bearing | ❌ refuted (ablation == with) |

### What actually holds

- **anti-slop-writing directionally over-applies in this sample.** Without it the model
  preserves an *earned* antithesis 5/5; with it mounted it flags the good writing as
  "slop" and degrades it ~4/5. Removing the flow/conclusion component doesn't fix it,
  so the false-positive pressure appears to be elsewhere. At five matched pairs this is
  still below the current two-sided sign-flip floor (`p≥0.0625`); rerun at ≥6 informative
  pairs before labeling it `CONFIRMED_CAUSAL` or acting on it as a confirmed effect.
- **The good-readme and testing "findings" were n=1 artifacts** — they evaporated at
  n=5. The lesson is the harness's own thesis: single-shot judged ablations stay
  INDETERMINATE; the confirmation gate (verified provenance + an *observed,
  replicated* regression on a cited assertion) would refuse to mark these
  CONFIRMED_CAUSAL.
- **Half the skills are saturated on these cases** — base Claude already does the
  right thing, so the skill's marginal value lives in harder positive cases, not the
  negatives sampled here.

(Structural note: good-readme is a 7.5 KB router over 97 KB of references; swiss-poster
concentrates 54% of its body in one section; good-repo's guidance is many tiny rules
with no load-bearing chunk. See the migration handover for per-component byte sizes.)

## Reproduce it (no vendoring)

```bash
SKILL=anti-slop-writing
read REPO SHA <<<"$(python3 -c "import json;d=json.load(open('examples/skill-pins.json'))['skills']['$SKILL'];print(d['repo'],d['sha'])")"

# fetch the skill at its pinned commit, on demand (nothing is stored in this repo)
curl -sSL -H "Authorization: Bearer $GITHUB_TOKEN" "https://api.github.com/repos/$REPO/tarball/$SHA" | tar xz
cd adewale-$SKILL-*    # repo root at the pinned tree

# prove it is the exact evaluated tree (must equal tree_hash in skill-pins.json)
python3 -c "import json,skill_benchmark as sb; from pathlib import Path; print(sb.canonical_skill_tree_hash(Path('.'), json.load(open('evals/shared-benchmark.json'))))"

# run the arms with your runner
HARNESS=/path/to/skill_benchmark.py
python3 $HARNESS prepare evals/shared-benchmark.json --split tune --include-ablations \
  --ablation-dir /tmp/abl --runs-per-variant 6 --out /tmp/tasks.jsonl
python3 $HARNESS run-codex --tasks /tmp/tasks.jsonl --runs /tmp/runs --codex-cmd "claude -p"
python3 - <<'PY' > /tmp/ablation-variants.args
import json
manifest = json.load(open('evals/shared-benchmark.json'))
print(' '.join(f"--variant ablation:{a['id']}" for a in manifest.get('ablations', [])))
PY
python3 $HARNESS benchmark evals/shared-benchmark.json --runs /tmp/runs \
  --variant with_skill --variant without_skill $(cat /tmp/ablation-variants.args)
```

Note: the skills' *shipped* manifests declare **instruction-simulated** ablations
(label-only), so `--include-ablations` gives non-blind, raw-measurement arms. To run
the **materialized** ablations used above (real removals, blind, confirmation-gradeable),
drop the verified `mechanism`+`target` specs from the migration handover into each
manifest's `ablations` (or run `audit-manifest`, which flags every instruction-simulated
ablation and names the mechanism to upgrade it). See
[`docs/skill-ablation-spec.md`](skill-ablation-spec.md).
